# Adventures in Fenestra

Fenestra considers itself the leader in the civilized world, but the forest is full of dangers, and always threaten to reclaim the land.

The dwarves and gnomes live underground.
The elves have their magics to deal with the situation.
Only mankind sits at the precariously beside the menacing nature.

Anyone who has not found a use for themselves can find a use in the Night Guard - the group charged by the Rex to go to the front lines and beat back the forest.
