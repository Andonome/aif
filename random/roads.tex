{\Glsfmttext{horseDrops}}% NAME
{The mounts eat something poisonous}% SUMMARY

The troupe's mounts find some tasty red moss by the side of the road.
Unfortunately, these are \glspl{horseDrops}, so their mounts will soon become ineffective, then die, if the \glspl{pc} don't notice.

\begin{boxtext}
  A playful mist wanders along the road as you take a short break to eat, and talk without the constant noise of the beasts of burden, stomping.
  The beasts themselves entertain themselves with red moss at the roadside.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{Spotting the moss}
requires a \roll{Wits}{Survival} roll (\tn[10]).

Failure means the mounts have eaten the moss, and will gain 1~\gls{ep} each \gls{interval} until they lie down, clearly sick (but with no clear cause).
Understanding the illness at that stage requires a \roll{Wits}{Survival} roll (\tn[14]).
Once the beasts dies, it explodes in red spores, and anyone breathing them in makes a \roll{Strength}{Cultivation} roll to avoid the sickness (healthy eaters can resist the illness better).

\paragraph{Curing the beasts}
requires a \roll{Intelligence}{Cultivation} roll (\tn[12]).
