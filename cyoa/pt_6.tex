\mapentry[withBlessing]{Leaving the hut}
\Gls{bogwitch} recommends an easy route through the bog, and everyone marches fast, then clambours uphill to the road.

%You've past the bog, and the blessing gives you confidence.
%A lot of people don't like witches, but everyone likes having on on their side.

Straight ahead, the setting Sun illuminates a cave-mouth just a hundred \glspl{step} into the forest.
To the left, a group of \glspl{sunGuard} march further into the distance.
Ahead of them, a great white head breaches the canopy and looks around silently.

The \glspl{sunGuard} haven't seen Bino.
The wind blows towards her, so they can't smell her either.
