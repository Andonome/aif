\mapentry[shootGuard]{Drawing the \glsfmttext{bow}}
does not attract the \glspl{sunGuard}' attention.
Even pointing the arrow directly at the closest face does nothing, as they stare behind you.
Bino's six legs stamped closer, the arrow flies out and sticks into \pgls{sunGuard} arm.
He cries in pain, and you flee into the shadows of the forest, hearing Bino's feet stamp fast behind.
Then the feet stops, and Bino turns back.

People sometimes call \glspl{monster} `the voiceless'.
\Pgls{basilisk} can barely hiss, \glspl{griffin} can only cry in another's voice, and \glspl{crawler} have nothing but silence.
They say \glspl{monster} envy our voices, and hate us for it.

As the \glspl{sunGuard} try to stab at Bino's rock-hard hide, voices in the shadows by the road ask ``\textit{are you ready?}''.
The other \glspl{guard} stand around you, \glspl{bow} at the ready, and nearly invisible in their black cassocks.

Arrows fly out and stick in Bino's skin like a bed of reeds.
Some arrows miss, and hit \glspl{sunGuard} (a natural result of interfering in another \gls{temple}'s domain).
And then one hits Bino in the eye, and she falls like a chalk tower.

Stepping out the forest, onto the starlit road, the \glspl{guard} light their \glspl{torch} and start \gls{harvesting} the corpse.
Roll \roll{Charisma}{Empathy} at \tn[10] if you want to claim the head.
