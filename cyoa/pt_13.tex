and through the bushes.
A moment later, the \glspl{guard} say `psst, quiet!', and point behind you.

Bino runs past, and straight towards the \gls{sunGuard}, trampling them down, and ripping arms off with her teeth.
After a couple of limbs drop to the ground, and the rest of the \gls{sunGuard} have lost their wits completely, you jump out with the other \glspl{guard}.

All together, you rush out with axes and glaives held overhead.
The \glspl{guard} stab and thrust, and half of them miss, but every hit breaks a bone or dents her tail.

Roll to attack with $2D6$ plus the Bonuses.
