\label{5E}

You turn to the \gls{sunGuard}, and lose the arrow at the smarmy git who kept asking stupid questions.
He cries in pain, and Bino's entire body turns to him.

All monsters love noise, because noise means prey.
Monsters themselves have no voice; a basilisk can barely hiss, \glspl{crawler} are arachnids, and \glspl{digger} have to use the tortured cries of their prey as a mating call.
