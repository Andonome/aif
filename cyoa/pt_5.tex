\mapentry[takeCoin]{The \glsfmtlong{sp} pressed into your palm}
tells you that the \glspl{sunGuard} won't leave you side until they have Bino's head.
They ask pointed questions about the habits of sheep, implying that you've grown up as a shepherd in the outer regions, by the \gls{edge}.
They emphasise how they -- having been raised in a town -- know very little of the lives and mannerisms of sheep.

The mockery stops as four figures in black fast-march along the road, catch up, and leave before the \gls{sunGuard} can crack any more jokes.

\begin{speechtext}
  ``Those must be \glspl{guard}; what are they up to?''
\end{speechtext}

You can only guess they want to kill Bino.

  ``\textit{If you want that head, we'd better run and overtake them.
  Back soon!}''

  \willYe{Stick to the deal.}%
  {``\textit{I can't imagine what those people are doing.
  We're just going to stick with you lot, as we promised!}''}%
