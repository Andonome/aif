\mapentry[bogspy]{Everyone discusses the route}
as some bog is mud, and other parts have deep cavities full of stagnant water, and you can barely tell which is which until you step in them.
As the cold water goes up to your boots, then drains into the boots, everyone realizes they've hit another kettle hole.

Tentacles emerge, each as tall as a man, to grab you and the elf.

\paragraph{Flee,}
and leave the elf to die.
\goTo{bogAtDusk}

\paragraph{Attack the tentacles,}
roll $2D6$ + {\scshape Att} at \glsentrylong{tn}~10.

\begin{description}
  \item[If you roll 10]
  you stab the creature, and it flees.
  \item[Rolling under 10]
  and the creature pulls you under and bites through your leg with its beak.
  {\scshape Cause of Death:} \gls{woodspy}
