\mapentry[toHut]{You knock on the door}
An aging voice, like a flute made of stone, invites you inside the creeking door.
The shelves look like they might collapse at any moment with the weight of all those jars, candles, boxes, books, lanterns, sacks, and frying pans.

An old woman, face covered in tattoos, stands taller than anyone you've ever met, and introduces herself as `\gls{bogwitch}'.
She aks about your day and your business.
She asks basic questions about the guilds, and doesn't seem to understand how the \gls{templeOfBeasts} also works as a guild, but has no `priests'.
And once she hears the word `Bino', her eyes widen.
