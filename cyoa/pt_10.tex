\mapentry[skullCave]{Everyone dashes}
into the forest's black underside.
\Glspl{monster} stalk in the dusk-light, but perhaps having Bino nearby makes you somehow safer.
Maybe she'll scare the smaller \glspl{monster} away?

Running faster now, the \glspl{sunGuard} shout at each other to ``\textit{hold!}'', then coughing, retching, and screams.

But that's over there.
Here in the cave, the dusk-light glints on two white skulls.
\Gls{basilisk} skulls.
They must have died during their hibernation --- last \gls{cTwo} when the snow lay deep --- and never woke up.
You remember your promise to \gls{bogwitch}\ldots she only needs a 'head'.
Perhaps this counts?
