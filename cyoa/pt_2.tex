\mapentry[toRoad]{The pregnant woman complains}
bitterly and performatively, about disobeying orders.
She refuses to tell anyone what crime she committed to end up working in the \gls{templeOfBeasts}.

By afternoon, you reach a crossroad.
A dozen men in shiny-white tabards wave at you from the far road.

\begin{speechtext}
  Well, well!
  Looks like we'll be travelling together!
  What sort of business are you lot involved in then?
\end{speechtext}

Before you can interject, the hooded man tells them, and the fakeness disappears.

\begin{speechtext}
  `Listen, our \gls{warden} (and so your \gls{warden} too) has fallen sick.
  He needs \pgls{elixir}, but the \gls{templeOfSickness} have none.
  We need Bino's head, but the problem is, we're not cut out for this sort of thing.
  We do justice, you lot do beasts.

  But we can pay up-front.
  Here, take these coins, ten silver's more than fair, and we'll stick with you, or just behind, till we get the head.
\end{speechtext}

The \gls{sunGuard}'s enormous mouth widens without an actual smile as he tries to press the coins into your hands.

\paragraph{Take the money.}
\goTo{takeCoin}

\paragraph{Refuse,}
and flee to the bog before the \glspl{sunGuard} become violent.
\goTo{bogAtDusk}
