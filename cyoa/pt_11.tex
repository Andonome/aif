\mapentry[readyBow]{The arrow flies}
perfectly into Bino's shoulder.
But she doesn't care --- it just stands embedded in her thick, white, skin.
She could bear arrows until she looked like a hedgehog and still run forwards, trampling everyone she sees.

Trampling over the \gls{sunGuard}, she stops to feed on one, paying no attention as the rest gag and retch as her awful smell.
And now the smell has spread, it smells like old pig's milk.

Time to back off slowly, back into the swamp.

Fin.
