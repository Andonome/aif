\mapentry[toBog]{Bogs nurture nothing but rot}
so anything that lives inside tends to grow small.
Bogs are infertile places, where very little grows, and what grows tends to be small.
They cannot even fester, they can barely rot.
So when someone troubles themselves to build a house in a bog, they must have an excellent reason.
However, you can't imagine what the reason might be for the hut, or tall roof.

  \willYe{Stay the hell away from strange houses,}%
    {continue walking the bog!}%
