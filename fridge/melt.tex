\subsection{The Roots}

\mapentry[fStairs]{Stairs}

\mapentry[fWell]{Well}

\mapentry[fOffice]{Office}

Stacks of catalogues hold information on every item within the Fridge, including the books in the giftschrank (room \vref{fGiftschrank}).
A ledger notes everyone who has passed in or out over the last five years.

However, nothing contains any information on the hidden door in room \vref{fBarrels}.

\mapentry[fGuardDoor]{Guard Post}

In the distance, a man flails his arms, hoping to get someone's attention.

\mapentry[fFuneraryVault]{Funerary Vault}

Two massive marble doors slide to either side to retain the cold.
The dead may rest in cold solace, the natural chill of this chamber keeping them inert.
Several cold metal slabs and marble containers line the walls and sides of the chamber. 

The dead stir as the chamber thaws. 

\mapentry[fBarrels]{Wine Barrels}

Not all barrels contain wine.
Once barrel lays stuck on its side (held down by stone pillars, embedded in its underside), and covers a small tunnel to the next room.

\mapentry[fGnomePassages]{Narrow Rooms}

Nobody bothered to scrape off the snow here, so these rooms collected frost.
The hall is now so narrow that nobody can fit through if their Strength is above -1.

\mapentry[fHibernation]{Hibernation Cells}

When umberhulks feel cold, they hibernate.
And if they remain cold, they can hibernate for decades before waking up.

\Glspl{crawler} cannot survive so long, but can still remain alive for a few years.

In total, the chamber contains:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  2 \glspl{crawler}
  \item
  4 Umber hulks
  \item
  Ksha, the dragon.
\end{itemize}

\mapentry[fLibrarians]{Wolf, Goat, and Librarian}

The three \glspl{seeker} who had their books here have not dressed appropriately for prolonged contact with the freezing cold, and have become so cold they can barely move.

All three want to save the most valuable books, and none of them want to let either of the other two walk out with those books.

\mapentry[fGiftschrank]{Giftschrank}

Banned but well-worn books and pamphlets remain here, where uneducated people won't be in danger of getting ideas.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \textit{Mungrit's Lewd Limericks, Volume IV} (3 \glspl{sp})
  \item
  \textit{On the Metaphysics of Government as a Super Organism} (10 \glspl{gp}, but buyers are hard to find)
  \item
  \textit{The Sexual Lives of Gnolls} (1 \gls{gp})
  \item
  \textit{Tsog's Vile Verses, Volume VIII} (2 sp)
  \item
  \textit{An Abridged History of Warfare} (1 \gls{gp})
  \item
  \textit{Life in an Elven Stronghold} (2 \glspl{sp})
  \item
  \textit{The Daring Adventures of Scrib the Dullard} (3 \glspl{cp})
\end{itemize}
