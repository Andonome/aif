\section{The Fridge}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
The \gls{templeOfFrost} holds a massive, underground fridge, used by the entire city to store food, \glspl{ingredient}, and hibernating \glspl{monster}.

Just about every \gls{temple} in the city holds something down there, and none of them trust the others enough to go down and fetch anything, for fear they'll place the items in their own area.

\subsection{The Roots}

\mapentry[fStairs]{Stairs}

Descending these long stairs turns the noisy streets above into silence, and replaces the
\ifnum\value{temperature}>2%
  warm air with cold%
\else%
  \showTemperature\ winds with stagnant air%
\fi.

\mapentry[fHallStore]{Barrels in the Hallway}
\begin{exampletext}
  \Pgls{wheatGuild} \gls{landlord} has been experimenting with brewing larger, but has moved the barrels into the warm hallway too early.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}
  Creaks are coming from the left.
  An alcove has two dozen barrels.
  Wood occasionally creaks but nothing is moving.
\end{boxtext}

\mapentry[fLift]{Crank Shaft}

\begin{exampletext}
  The \gls{weaversGuild} lies directly above this room, so the \gls{templeOfFrost} commissioned a lift here.
  They don't need a lift, but the \gls{templeOfPoison} \emph{really} need a lift for their barrels, so they can avoid the stairs.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}
  This circular room has nothing inside but a tapestry depicting a naked man with a peaceful smile and a black nose, sleeping in the snow.
  It stretches from the ceiling down to a wheel on the wall.
  The wheel has four metal rods sticking out, and one wedged into a hole in the ground.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} look behind the depiction of \gls{sable},}
they find two chains reaching from the crank through the ceiling.

\paragraph{Removing the rod and turning the crank}
lowers a circular segment of the ceiling, and exposes the \gls{weaversGuild} above.

\begin{boxtext}
  The wheel spins with a rusty squeal, and light floods down from behind a circular segment of the ceiling.
  Four chains lower the wooden disk gently.
  A fire crackles above as six women look down, with stitches in their hand.
  A dozen voices from above ask `who's that?', and `where are you going?', `is it cold down there?', `do you need a jumper?'.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} stop to chat,}
they can gain useful information and free \gls{equipment} but lose time chatting.
People who work in the \gls{weaversGuild} take in facts like a river drinks.
Every day, everyone in the town needs their clothes washed, mended, adjusted or more clothes created.
The \glspl{weaver} now think it's normal to recite recipes, while memorizing a weave pattern, by listening to an argument about how to start it.

\begin{speechtext}
  \rotatebox{-3}{Do you need \pgls{torch}?
  We've got one here somewhere!}

  Do you know about the barrels?
  Very important, they said.
  Dwarvish `special ale', they said.
  Should be good.

  {\small
    Is that you, `\composeHumanName'?
    I don't see so well now.
  }

  \vspace{-.5em}
  {\large
    Mind the dragon!
    We don't want you to get \emph{too} roasty-toasty.
  }

  That dragon's not real!
  Did you lot hunt any \gls{griffin} recently?
  It's just that we could use some parts soon.
  I got this new preservation technique\ldots

  \vspace{-.3em}
  \rotatebox{5}{Mind ye shut that hatch!}
\end{speechtext}

The \glspl{weaver} happily gift the \glspl{pc} anything they might reasonably have to-hand.
Each item costs $1D6$~\glspl{ap} while someone locates it and passes it down to the troupe.

\paragraph{Before the \glspl{pc} leave}
the \glspl{weaver} \emph{demand} that they crank the floor back up so they don't have to worry about any \glspl{monster} coming up.

\begin{speechtext}
  We're not light the fire to listen to it, okay?

  \vspace{-.4em}
  \rotatebox{4}{Is that cunt with the silly hat down there?}

  \vspace{-.4em}
  \rotatebox{5}{\large I hope there is a dragon, so it eats him.}

  \vspace{-.3em}
  \rotatebox{-5}{\small That the one that called your one a `hussy'?}

  \rotatebox{3}{\slshape I put some sugar in his caskets, that'll teach him\ldots}

  Too right!
  He puts his aprons in here again and I know the stitches I'll fray.

  \vspace{-.3em}
  \rotatebox{3}{\slshape Sootmill!  That's dirty.}

  \vspace{-.3em}
  \rotatebox{-2}{\sl Tell Cuspid I kept his tea warm!}

\end{speechtext}

\mapentry[fWheat]{Flour Drying Room}

\Glspl{server} scatter dusty chalk in this room so it can absorb the moisture, and let the flour dry.
The flour rests in wide-open trays, stacked on shelves.

The room has no brush, so if \pgls{pc} enters, they cannot help their chalky footprints.

\mapentry[fIngStore]{\Glsfmtplural{ingredient} Storage}

The \gls{templeOfFrost} keeps \glspl{ingredient} for preservation \gls{alchemy} in here,
\footnote{Fate and Air \glsfmtplural{ingredient}}
along with steel cauldrons, glass tubes, books on \gls{alchemy} and other rare materials.
Each one has \pgls{weight}~1 and could fetch around 5~\glspl{sp}.

\paragraph{Opening the door}
requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Crafts} check.

\begin{boxtable}
  \Gls{tn}~12 & The \gls{pc} slides the inner bolt across, cracks the door, then gently pulls it upward to avoid any squeak as it opens. \\
  \Gls{tn}~10 & They open the door, and the rusting hinges squeal so loud that the \glspl{weaver} above \vref{fLift} hear the intrusion, and decide that the \glspl{pc} are the `wrong sort'. \\
  \Gls{tn}~9 & They break the lock-mechanism while slamming the door open, which breaks a mirror and some half-prepared Fate~\glspl{ingredient}. \\
\end{boxtable}

\mapentry[fOffice]{Office}

The \gls{templeOfHate} have secured rights to record everything which passes through here to stop the other \glspl{temple} fighting.
Stacks of catalogues hold information on every item within the fridge, including the books in the giftschrank (room \vref{fGiftschrank}).
A ledger notes everyone who has passed in or out over the last five years.

However, nothing contains any information on the hidden door in room \vref{fBarrels}.

Finding specific information in the \nameref{fOffice} means sorting through the \gls{temple}'s peculiar style of record-keeping, and their own brand of short-hand notes.
This isn't intentional encryption, which somehow makes it feel even worse.

A player can roll \roll{Wits}{Academics} at \tn[14].
A tie means they find something interesting, while beating the \gls{tn} means finding what they went looking for.

\mapentry[fDip]{Chasm Barrels}

\begin{exampletext}
  These little runways, down to a natural cavity and back up again, make the worst part of anyone's day if they have to transport barrels through here.
  Unfortunately, the \gls{wheatGuild} refuse to pay for a small bridge.
\end{exampletext}

The cavity has two-dozen barrels of cooking oil.
If the oil ever spills and receives 8~Damage from fire, it combusts, inflicting $\dmg{-2}$~Damage.
The fire continues to inflict the same Damage rolled, minus one, each \gls{round}.
So `3~Damage' continues to burn for another 2~Damage on the second \gls{round}, then 1~Damage before dying down.
\Gls{dr} only counts for the first \gls{round} as the oil seeps into the cracks while heating the armour.
\iftoggle{verbose}{
  \Glspl{fp} which mitigate the Damage reduce the Damage on subsequent \glspl{round}.
}{}

\mapentry[fSide]{Side Store}

% What behind this secret door?  I don't know.  Perhaps it's a tragedy of the
% commons, waiting to flood.  Perhaps everyone wants to leave 'substance X'
% alone, with the secret door closed, so water does not Damage it.  But they all
% know they can rescue a little of substance X if they open the door and grab
% what they can.

%%%%%%%%%%%%

\mapentry[fBoat]{Boat by the Shore}

Any \gls{pc} with at least 2 points in \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} spots a little boat, tethered to the shore.
It can take a total \gls{weight} of~50.
\iftoggle{verbose}{
  \footnote{Characters have \pglsxtrshort{weight} equal to their maximum \glsfmtlongpl{hp} plus their items' \glsfmttext{weight}.}
}{}

\begin{boxtext}
  The \gls{torch}-light shines on a canopy of stone pillars, standing in an underground lake.
  The shore has no tide.
  The water lies like a mirror.
\end{boxtext}


\mapentry[fGuardDoor]{Guard Post}

\begin{exampletext}
  When the cavern's thaw began, Renchkolt asked 
\end{exampletext}

In the distance, a man flails his arms, hoping to get someone's attention.

\mapentry[fCrossbow]{Funerary Vault}

Fuckin' massive crossbow.

\mapentry[fWeaponStore]{Weapon Storage}

\mapentry[fHibernation]{Hibernation Cells}

When umberhulks feel cold, they hibernate.
And if they remain cold, they can hibernate for decades before waking up.

\Glspl{crawler} cannot survive so long, but can still remain alive for a few years.

In total, the chamber contains:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  2 \glspl{crawler}
  \item
  4 \glspl{hulk}
  \item
  Ksha, the dragon.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%

\mapentry[fBarrels]{Wine Barrels}

Not all barrels contain wine.
Once barrel lays stuck on its side (held down by stone pillars, embedded in its underside), and covers a small tunnel to the next room.

\mapentry[fCheeseStorage]{Hall of Cheese}

The entrace hall looks like someone carved the walls into a perfect pattern of repeating cylinder-sides.
But in fact the walls just have shelves which bulge with cheese wheels.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\mapentry[fLibrarians]{Wolf, Goat, and Librarian}

The three \glspl{seeker} who had their books here have not dressed appropriately for prolonged contact with the freezing cold, and have become so cold they can barely move.

All three want to save the most valuable books, and none of them want to let either of the other two walk out with those books.

\mapentry[fGiftschrank]{Giftschrank}

Banned but well-worn books and pamphlets remain here, where uneducated people won't be in danger of getting ideas.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \textit{Mungrit's Lewd Limericks, Volume IV} (3 \glspl{sp})
  \item
  \textit{On the Metaphysics of Government as a Super Organism} (10 \glspl{gp}, but buyers are hard to find)
  \item
  \textit{The Sexual Lives of Gnolls} (1 \gls{gp})
  \item
  \textit{Tsog's Vile Verses, Volume VIII} (2 sp)
  \item
  \textit{Wars of \Glsentrytext{fenestra}, Vol. II} (1 \gls{gp})
  \item
  \textit{Life in an Elven Stronghold} (2 \glspl{sp})
  \item
  \textit{The Daring Adventures of Scrib the Dullard} (3 \glspl{cp})
\end{itemize}
