\subsection{My First Day}

The module might work for new \glspl{pc}.
Once the \gls{warden} hears of the fridge melting, he makes an expedient pre-court ruling that these new prisoners must join the \gls{guard}, and save the \glspl{monster} at once.

Or perhaps \pgls{pc} has entered the \gls{court} and received a lethal sentence.
But when the \gls{warden} sentences them to death and the gate at the side of the \gls{court} rises, \pgls{sunGuard} pokes his head out and say ``\textit{my \gls{warden}, we have a problem}''.

Or perhaps it works for neither.
Not a single word has been tempered in the fire of the table.
