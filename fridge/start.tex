\subsection{My First Day}

The module might work for new \glspl{pc}.
Once the \gls{warden} hears of the fridge melting, he makes an expedient pre-court ruling that these new prisoners must join the \gls{guard}, and save the \glspl{monster} at once.

Or perhaps \pgls{pc} has entered the \gls{court} and received a lethal sentence.
But when the \gls{warden} sentences them to death and the gate at the side of the \gls{court} rises, \pgls{sunGuard} pokes his head out and say ``\textit{my \gls{warden}, we have a problem}''.

Or perhaps it works for neither.
Not a single word has been tempered in the fire of the table.

\subsection{Time's Relentless March}

The session should track \glspl{round} from start to finish for every \gls{action}.
You can move round the table clockwise, and whenever \pgls{pc} runs out of \glspl{ap}, the rest must leave them behind or end the \gls{round}.

\subsubsection[An Escaped Prisoner]{10: An Escaped Prisoner}
jumps from the \gls{court} and out the doors of room \vref{fDoor}, then heads towards the nearest light (e.g. any \gls{torch} \pgls{pc} carries).
\Pgls{sunGuard} bolts after him a moment later with his own \gls{torch}, and the prisoner has to swim to safety.

The \glspl{pc} might not want to waste their time on this ruckus, but the \gls{sunGuard} wants their boat (he's not getting into that filthy water with his nice, white, vestige).
