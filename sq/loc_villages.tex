\noindent The villagers in \gls{redfall} have become tired of armed tax collectors.  If the characters enter the area, they will find peasants laying an ambush for them.

\begin{boxtext}

  As you step onto the bridge, you see a dozen men walking behind you with large bags covering their heads.  In front, another ten gather as well.  Each carry a large sack, then one reaches in and plucks out a rock.

\end{boxtext}

The farmers don't want to kill the characters -- just scare them off; but it will take some quick talking to stop the stoning before it begins.  The party may roll Wits + Empathy, TN 11.
If the characters are nearby a particular village, that's the village he assaults.
Otherwise, refer to Lakeside village, page \pageref{lakeside}.

The villagers have no idea that \gls{nurabaron} has been tainted with dark magic, they only know they haven't seen him in a long time, and that he has increased taxes, and takes almost all his taxes in food, back to the keep.

\humanfarmer[\npc{\T}{20 Angry Farmers}]

\paragraph{Once the fight is over,}
the leader of the group -- Matt -- will come forward, and may even apologize for the misunderstanding if the party have a good explanation as to why they're in \gls{redfall}.

\paragraph{If the party attempt to persuade the villagers to assault the keep,}
they can succeed with a Strength + Empathy roll, TN 10
(the villagers feel more confident with a strong character leading them).
Of course the villagers also know that the fortress is armed with archers, and will only agree to enter if the party remove those archers.

\paragraph{If the keep ever becomes surrounded by peasants,}
\gls{nurabaron} will run out to an archer's post with a massive bag of food doused in ogre-dust.
He will pour it down, shouting apologies about the lack of food, and any villagers who eat the food will begin to turn into ogres.
If the party aren't quick, they'll be in a keep surrounded by ogres.
There isn't enough food for everyone, so after some turn into ogres, they'll start to eat the others, and many will simply flee.
This will leave ten ogres who chase the villages, ten more who bang on the gates, and ten who decide to go round the back of the keep to look fruitlessly for alternative entrances.

\subsection*{\glsentrytext{redfall} Keep}

\toppic{Dyson_Logos/redfall_keep}{\label{redfall_keep_map}}

\setcounter{list}{0}

The keep contains a conspiracy: everyone in there knows that they harbour monsters, but they also know that those monsters can be cured, and that if they tell anyone, they'll lose their employment, and will either have to beg or join the \gls{guard}.

\mapentry{Towers}

Each of the towers has two archers, ready to protect their master, \gls{nurabaron}, as long as nobody gets too close.

\mapentry{Courtyard}

This open courtyard makes archery an easy job.  Anyone outside can easily be picked off if they do not have adequate shielding.

\mapentry{Toilet}

This spacious lavatory comes with a runoff to the river outside.
It also hosts arrow slits to fire at intruders on the river.
Small characters (with Strength of 0 or less) can fit through the gap from outside, if they are not wearing armour.

One of the horses here was accidentally hit by some of the ogre-dust which affected \gls{nurabaron} and his family.  It ate the others, but despite the men protesting, \gls{nurabaron} has insisted on keeping it alive and very well fed.

\mapentry{Kitchen}

The dwindling food supplies are kept here.  They build up to monstrous amounts, then get hurriedly eaten within a day or two.  Barrels of meats, stacks of bread, and multiple bottles of wine -- nothing lasts long.

\mapentry{Servants' Quarters}

This place holds various cots, chests, and washing equipment.  At present only six members of staff remain -- two cooks, two butlers, one diplomat,\footnote{See page \pageref{nathaniel} for Nathaniel the diplomat.} and James the tax collector.

\mapentry{Benjie's Room}

\Gls{nurabaron}'s youngest son Benjie is only a toddler.
He doesn't understand his condition, and has no self control.
This makes him dangerous, so the family have decided to lock him in this little room.
Characters on the river or anywhere near this room can hear intermittent banging, and infant-like gurgling.

\mapentry{The Smaller Courtyard}

This area holds a thin, thatched root, and plenty of space for games without getting wet.
It's used as a common area by the servants.

\mapentry{The Great Hall}

\begin{boxtext}

  You open the door to a massive table full of opulent food, and more food stacked on top.  Layers of bloody bones poke out the side of three layers of filthy dishes, lining the bottom of the feast.  At the head of the table, sits \gls{nurabaron}, in a meat-stained dressing gown.

\end{boxtext}

A heavy wooden door guards the entrance well, and a gate sits in front of that.  Lifting the gate takes a Strength + Athletics roll, TN 10, but the locks on the door don't give much resistance; players can pick them with Intelligence + Larceny, TN 6.  The bars are slim enough that anyone with a Weight Rating of 5 or less can just about squeeze through.

The hallways contains a long, messy dining table, covered in scraps of bones from all manner of animal.  The side alcoves contain little beds for guards to sleep in.  Four guards are in the area at any one time.

The baron can usually be found dining here, shouting at guards about some imagined insult, or just terrifying people for the fun of it.  Nathaniel, his trusted advisor, is the only one who can calm him down when he gets into a rage.

\mapentry{The Old Storage Shelves}

Here the servants rest.
The armoury was once staffed by men at arms, but now has nothing but ogre-powder and other magical items from the \textit{nura depths}.
Anyone disturbing the contents of this room must make a Dexterity + Crafts check, TN 7, or risk toppling something and spilling the powder everywhere, which will affect the characters as per the Saurecanta sphere (page \pageref{saurecanta}); specifically, they get +2 to Strength and Speed, but -4 to Intelligence and Charisma.
This powder is not nearly so potent as the charm cast upon \gls{nurabaron} and his family, so they will recover at the end of the scene if they have not eaten anything.
\footnote{See page \pageref{nura_recovery} for recovering from nura magic, and page \pageref{ogredust} for details on the `ogre dust'.}

\mapentry{The Hidden Family}

In the upper floor, \gls{nurabaron}'s wife Marjorie stays with her four children -- two boys and two girls.  All are a little too dangerous to be trusted wandering alone, so only one is let out of their room at a time.

These two attack fiercely, but retreat if any bargains have been made after a single round.

\ogre[\npc{\T\N\M}{Richard \& Jim}]

The two brothers were never good at listening, and will attack with abandon, unless Marjorie is nearby to talk them down.

\subsection{Lakeside Village}
\index{Lakeside Village}

Lakeside is a small, walled, village with a large and proud temple to Ohta resting at its side, waiting for battle.%
\footnote{Lakeside has no fixed location. Place it anywhere on the map, whenever you need a detailed village.}

The tall stone walls reach 4 metres into the air.
The bridges are made of wood, and ready to burn at a moment's notice if part of the village get in trouble.
The river running through the centre is not dangerous, but is strong enough to sweep almost anyone away if they try to swim against it.

Lakeside has an unusually large number of well-armed young soldiers, ready to fight for their little patch of the world at a moment's notice.
It is lead by Village Master Solus, who is also the area's leader of the weapons' guild -- a small organization who are permitted to produce weapons, which are then sold to the Night's Guard.

The ports here provide an important trade to the surrounding areas, and the river provides a relatively safe route out of the area.
This port provides the only  source of raw iron to the town, so if the village ever perishes, the price of weapons will double.

\paragraph{If you use this area for a ghoul attack with \gls{necromancer},}
the ghouls approach underwater and come up from the river.
\subsubsection{The King's Statue}

The town's central square contains a statue of \gls{king} looking lordly.
It was built over a level 2 mana lake, so the entire town will allow a spell-caster to regenerate 1 MP per turn, and anyone closer to the statue will regenerate 2 per turn.

As only officials of the Temple of Ohta can sell weapons, the village takes pains to show support to \gls{king}, as the weapons provide the majority of its wealth.

\subsubsection{Ohta's House}

The miniature citadel houses over 1,000 swords, 2,000 shields, and 20,000 arrows, ready for sale.
