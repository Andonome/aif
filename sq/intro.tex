These random Side Quests weave a complete story once told together.
If you have a plot-arc in mind already, you can pull out a couple of these random encounters as flavouring for your campaign, or just slot them in when you've not prepared enough material for the night.
Alternatively, you can lump the lot together, and run them as a major plot-arc.

The stories begin during the season of \season, so take a look at page \pageref{astronomy} for a description.

The overall plot contains two major arcs:

\section{The Story so Far}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Expanding Wilderness}
\label{expanding_wilderness}

\noindent
In the words of \gls{townmaster}:

\begin{exampletext}

  Our city has burnt to the ground so long ago that people have forgotten where it is.
  They just call it `\gls{lostcity}'.

  It had its own little College of Alchemy, and a great logging industry, until the elves came.
  They thought they owned all the forest and they couldn't share, so they started telling people to get out, and when they didn't, they just killed everyone.
  Every single man, woman and child, dead or driven out.

  Well it's time to take back what's ours.
  I've sent trackers out, and it's so overgrown they say you can walk through the old city and not notice you're in it.
  They say it's huge, but the original stone is in there -- buried under all the trees and bushes the elves summoned up with their black magics.

  I've commissioned an outpost, and kept it hidden.
  We'll have more information once they finish their rounds.

  This time it'll be different.
  This time we have a strong king, and he won't let the area fall.
  Once we have the area built up, I'll take the lead, and move in with the king's army.

  Of course, at present, \gls{king} doesn't know about this, and one cannot procure and army without good cause.
  For the moment, I've had to speak with some unsavoury characters who've agreed to work under my direction.
  \Gls{traitor} has understood the gravity of the situation, and has organized some criminals he knows to carry out their orders.

\end{exampletext}

While \gls{townmaster} has kept his small, but illegal army secret, \gls{forestpriest} has already learned of it, and decided to intervene.

This secret army, along with all the information required to keep them safe, a few such as weapons, and political protection at the right time, it orchestrated by \gls{traitor} of \gls{nightguard}.

\begin{exampletext}

  My typical excuse has been scouting.
  I take my horse, and enough money for plenty of supplies, then simply leave the guard house in \gls{town} for a few weeks.
  Initially, \gls{captain} was irritated at my apparent abandonment of duties, but recently we've started hearing of other bandits.
  It's been a real blessing.
  Whenever I come back, I tell him something of their movements, whether I've seen them or not.

  Of course, most of the time, I simply go back to the \gls{greentower} and meet with the others.
  They're good men -- none chose to live as bandits, but times are tough.
  There are so many woodspies around \gls{lostcity} that we started calling ourselves the Woodspy Bandits, and somehow the name just stuck.

\end{exampletext}

\subsection{The Nura Conspiracy}

In the words of \gls{banditking}:

\begin{exampletext}

  We came from something, and we'll return.

  After \gls{king} sent his \gls{nightguard} to kill our parents, take our land, and hand it to bureaucrats, \gls{sewerking} fled from \gls{college}, and I guided him safely out of Whiteplains, North to Mount Arthur.
  \footnote{See page \pageref{whiteplainsWar}.}
  We've seen ten cycles\footnote{See \autoref{astronomy}.} pass, and started planning our return to nobility.
  And if \gls{king} can play rough, then so can we.

  We've robbed a lot of people, and I don't feel good about that, but we really have no choice.
  We've done nothing worse than \gls{king}.

  I chose \gls{town} as it was out of the way, and we started to explore the area.
  Just him and me, wandering with our rations and picking up food.
  We were essentially living like bandits even before we became bandits.
  Soon enough, I found our home-to-be, where the dead priest lives.
  He's a shy creature, but we've gained an understanding.

  We came to his temple at night, so I saw an arrow cutting into the earth before I saw the building.
  I could clearly see it was a warning, but didn't understand how anyone could possibly see us walking in the darkness.
  Any idiot could tell that nobody sat there with an army, or we would have heard them, and they could have killed us.
  So we kept back until daylight, and went out again, cloaks waving about, hailing whoever might be there.
  And another arrow went into the ground -- another warning shot.
  When we saw the crumbling temple, alone in the forest, we knew we'd found a new home, despite the arrows.

  It took a long time to make friends with the dead priest.

  We stayed put, camping nearby, and the dead priest came to me in my dreams.
  We spoke for a while -- from a distance.
  In dreams, the dead can fear the living.
  After spending so much time alone, I honestly thing he's gained a fear of the living.
  Like people who hate spiders, but he just can't stand to see anything animate and moving about on its own.

  We don't want to kill people, just get enough money to get by.
  But of course, accidents happen, and at those times, we return with the bodies and give them to \gls{necromancer}.
  He's been building up quite the little army down there.
  It got to be a bit of a problem after a while -- I'm not afraid of the dead wandering about at night, in fact I've become quite used to it.
  \emph{However}, after one attacked me, things had to change.
  \gls{necromancer} eventually gave me a ring which would make me invisible to the dead, and another for my brother.
  We can't wear them for too long, but we can stay a night in the temple without worry, and the dead do not attack our horses.

  So here we sit, in our tower, planning our next move.
  \gls{sewerking} has a plan to take over the entire area, king be damned.


\end{exampletext}

In the words of \gls{sewerking}:

\begin{exampletext}

  I had to return from my studies in \gls{college} to rescue \gls{banditking}, and found him hiding in some seedy bar, as if the \gls{nightguard} had such a high opinion of him that they wouldn't think to look for him there.
  I organized our escape, and found us lodgings with the little coin we still had.

  It started with \gls{pig}.
  \Gls{pigowner} heard our coins a mile away -- people with money don't normally stay in \gls{pig} for more than they need to get the gossip, and don't take their money in with them.
  We stayed in a little area she had tucked away, underneath, and she told us the tale of how there was once an underground library, and temple, and all sorts down there.

  We started cleaning the place out.
  We put on these rings that \gls{necromancer} had gifted us, and found we could hold our breath underwater for a good long time, and set to work investigating what we could in the darkness.
  As luck would have it, we found one passage gave way easily to our shovels, so we expanded it, and pulled out junk and crap stuck in there for centuries, and pushed some more, cleared more, and eventually managed to divert the water pouring downwards.
  We slunk through all the shit of \gls{town} for a solid month, and eventually the waters started to recede.

  We have our own underground palace now.
  It's dirty, and wet, it's dark and dank, but it's ours, and we can store anything we need down there.
  And it has treasures.

  So. Many. Treasures.

  It has an old brazier which infuses any corpse with a malicious spirit.
  It has an alter of skulls which whisper your fortunes and mishaps.
  And it has old scrolls, secreted away, which describe the forbidden magics of the nura.
  
  So I've begun to study that magic, and create magical items.
  And I've asked the skulls about my fortune, and sometimes they tell me I will kill \gls{townmaster}, so now I know I am destined to rule this land.
  And I've begun to steal the bodies to create an army down here.

  We can't have the dead just wandering around, so we lock them up in little cages.
  We have over a dozen cages, just full of the hungry dead, waiting to get out and tear the town apart.

  And we have used the dead to create tunnels.
  We've dug into the catacombs of \gls{town}'s temple of Qualm\"{e}, and started another which will soon reach underneath the citadel.
  Then we can release the dead into the citadel, and take out \gls{townmaster}.

  Tunnels and skulls, forgotten magics in scrolls, and secret passages.
  Everything will come together soon, but we need one more piece before we rule this land\ldots

\end{exampletext}

Throughout the encounters, a number of them prompt the local Nura Rating to rise (see chapter \ref{nura}).
At the start the party may have little to worry about, but before the end most of their excursions will be interrupted by rampaging goblins and ogres.
Only by finding and plugging the portals to the nura lands -- both in \gls{town} and the forest -- can the party return the land to a state of normality.
