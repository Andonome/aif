\chapter{Locations}

I cannot provide much of a map, as I don't know where anything is.
However, do consider populating a map, or asking the players to do so.
When the group leaves \gls{town}, they can make a point on a map marked `town'.
If they encounter the bad bandits of Redfall, you now know that Redfall lies somewhere nearby.
Once they encounter \glsfmttext{greentower}, that will stay put on the map wherever they find it.

As the group wander the world, it can be filled out, bit by bit.
Maps at this point often have East at the start, so people can organize first thing in the morning by looking towards the rising Sun, so stick that in, then just have a map organically around it.
