\label{shadepaths}

Between the \glspl{plateauGardens}, great snails wander through shadowy canals.
The earth walls creak like the sound of ripping metal, as if they were about to collapse; but they never do.
Sunlight only falls at noon, so almost nothing grows.

These deep troughs receive few \glspl{mp}, so the atmosphere feels stagnant.
The troupe can only receive 1~\glspl{mp} at the end of each \gls{interval}, or 0~\glspl{mp} if \gls{LifeElder} wanders nearby.

  To stop the giant snails eating all the vegetables, \gls{LifeElder} cracked the land, sundering the soil and creating raised plateaus, where she and the other elves could live, cultivating plants.
  Meanwhile, the snails remained in the lower regions.
  Unfortunately, the elves could not get from one plateau to the other due the tall, sheer walls%
