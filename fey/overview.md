# Introduction

This oneshot has the players chase a giant snail through two elven territories.
Each elven territory has elves with radically different philosophies - the first values law and oaths, while the second values free thought and song.
But both have the same type of cause - whenever they have a problem, the elder fixes it with a massive spell; the spell creates more problems, and the elder fixes those problems with another spell, and so on, creating a delicate chain of spells, ready to fall.

The chain of spells follows the pattern of the children's song, *[There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Was_an_Old_Lady_Who_Swallowed_a_Fly)*.
Or perhaps it's more like a bad programmer, who patches bugs with dirty fixes, and patches those with more fixes, until nothing can be changed without the entire program collapsing.

## In the Kingdom of Oaths

> *Welcome to my Kingdom.  There is no crime here, because everyone who wishes to stay must promise to obey the law, and I bind them to their word by enchanted oaths.  This helps instil the lessons I wish I had when I was younger, and sets them in the right frame of mind for when they grow up and leave.  I use similar oaths on my goblin-police, but they cannot understand the subtleties, so I ask much less of their minds, and more of their bodies.*

- The ravens come when cawed.
- Ice-caves hold food and children.
- Only the Oath King stands between the goblin caves and the humans.
- My son would never marry without swearing to love his betrothed forever, and cannot marry until he finishes the next ogre monument.
- Goblins lead carnivorous snails away by letting them chase.

## In the Land of Plenty

> *There is no crime here, because 'crime' is just a thing in your mind, man.  Just let it go.  You only believe in theft because of your attachment to your things, but those things are just things.  When you see the world for what it is, all problems vanish, and you will have everything and nothing.  You don't need stuff, like swords, or cheese, or legs.  Legs are also just stuff, but they don't take you anywhere, you only get somewhere by deciding you are where you want to be.*

- In the garden of light, eating the wrong thing can make you float away.  Like it makes you light enough to float.  You'll be enlightened.
- *Catch that snail!  I don't want the Oathbringer to enchant him!*
- *The sword went to take cuttings off a bridge.  Someone will bring it back.  Don't worry about it, man.  It's just things.  Don't let your things control you, man.*
- Items are animals, like in the *Flintstones*.  Plates made from shells, snails as vehicles, cats mew whole songs, and fireflies express messages in Morse code.

## Conclusions

The PCs have many ways to cause chaos, but must put the chaos aside, and focus on what will stop giant, carnivorous snails from leaving the area (or from existing).
They must also avoid ecological changes which bring *more* monsters to human lands.

# History

## In the Land of Plenty

- LifeElder loved the little paths snails make, and wanted to walk across them, but she was too big.  To create her roads, she used Life spells to grow the snails to monstrous proportions.  But once they were as big as a house, they just got stuck in the tall trees.
- To fix the massive snails getting stuck, she gave them acidic vomit, so they could dissolve bushes and trees, burn through chitincrawler webs, and in general move freely.  Unfortunately, they ate all her vegetable patches.
- To stop the giant snails eating all the vegetables, LifeElder cracked the land, sundering the soil and creating raised plateaus, where she and the other elves could live, cultivating plants.  Meanwhile, the snails remained in the lower regions.  Unfortunately, the elves could not get from one plateau to the other due the tall, sheer walls.
- LifeElder did not like seeing the elves trapped on different plateaus, like some kind of jail.  She solved the problem by enchanting bean-vines to bridge nearby spaces between the plateaus, creating actual bridges.
- The bridges have held fine, the elves grow plants and sing songs (and sometimes, *vice versa*) on their plateaus.  And LifeElder feels content that she has solved all the problems with her spells.
