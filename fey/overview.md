# Introduction

This oneshot has the players chase a giant snail through two elven territories.
Each elven territory has elves with radically different philosophies - the first values law and oaths, while the second values free thought and song.
But both have the same type of cause - whenever they have a problem, the elder fixes it with a massive spell; the spell creates more problems, and the elder fixes those problems with another spell, and so on, creating a delicate chain of spells, ready to fall.

The chain of spells follows the pattern of the children's song, *[There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Was_an_Old_Lady_Who_Swallowed_a_Fly)*.
Or perhaps it's more like a bad programmer, who patches bugs with dirty fixes, and patches those with more fixes, until nothing can be changed without the entire program collapsing.

## In the Kingdom of Oaths

> *Welcome to my Kingdom.  There is no crime here, because everyone who wishes to stay must promise to obey the law, and I bind them to their word by enchanted oaths.  This helps instil the lessons I wish I had when I was younger, and sets them in the right frame of mind for when they grow up and leave.  I use similar oaths on my goblin-police, but they cannot understand the subtleties, so I ask much less of their minds, and more of their bodies.*

- The ravens come when cawed.
- Ice-caves hold food and children.
- Only the Oath King stands between the goblin caves and the humans.
- My son would never marry without swearing to love his betrothed forever, and cannot marry until he finishes the next ogre monument.
- Goblins lead carnivorous snails away by letting them chase.

## In the Land of Plenty

> *There is no crime here, because 'crime' is just a thing in your mind, man.  Just let it go.  You only believe in theft because of your attachment to your things, but those things are just things.  When you see the world for what it is, all problems vanish, and you will have everything and nothing.  You don't need stuff, like swords, or cheese, or legs.  Legs are also just stuff, but they don't take you anywhere, you only get somewhere by deciding you are where you want to be.*

- In the garden of light, eating the wrong thing can make you float away.  Like it makes you light enough to float.  You'll be enlightened.
- *Catch that snail!  I don't want the Oathbringer to enchant him!*
- *The sword went to take cuttings off a bridge.  Someone will bring it back.  Don't worry about it, man.  It's just things.  Don't let your things control you, man.*
- Items are animals, like in the *Flintstones*.  Plates made from shells, snails as vehicles, cats mew whole songs, and fireflies express messages in Morse code.

## Conclusions

The PCs have many ways to cause chaos, but must put the chaos aside, and focus on what will stop giant, carnivorous snails from leaving the area (or from existing).
They must also avoid ecological changes which bring *more* monsters to human lands.

# History

## In the Land of Plenty

- LifeElder loved the little paths snails make, and wanted to walk across them, but she was too big.  To create her roads, she used Life spells to grow the snails to monstrous proportions.  But once they were as big as a house, they just got stuck in the tall trees.
- To fix the massive snails getting stuck, she gave them acidic vomit, so they could dissolve bushes and trees, burn through chitincrawler webs, and in general move freely.  Unfortunately, they ate all her vegetable patches.
- To stop the giant snails eating all the vegetables, LifeElder cracked the land, sundering the soil and creating raised plateaus, where she and the other elves could live, cultivating plants.  Meanwhile, the snails remained in the lower regions.  Unfortunately, the elves could not get from one plateau to the other due the tall, sheer walls.
- LifeElder did not like seeing the elves trapped on different plateaus, like some kind of jail.  She solved the problem by enchanting bean-vines to bridge nearby spaces between the plateaus, creating actual bridges.
- The bridges have held fine, the elves grow plants and sing songs (and sometimes, *vice versa*) on their plateaus.  And LifeElder feels content that she has solved all the problems with her spells.

## In the Kingdom of Oaths

- With the old lich killed, MindElder decided to settle down, build the perfect tower, and raise perfect children in a perfect land.
- Unfortunately, the children stole, fought, and disobeyed his orders to stay at home and keep safe.  He made them all swear oaths to uphold the law, never harming any elf, nor taking property, nor singing out of key.
- Without the ability to sing out of key, none have learnt to sing, but this turned out to be an improvement, as MindElder always enjoyed silence more than song.

The Kingdom of Oaths remained peaceful, until giant snails entered, ate through all of the gardens.

- MindElder stopped the snails eating through his gardens by twisting their tiny minds towards eating flesh rather than plants.  This helped clear out chitincrawlers from the area, as the slugs would destroy their webs with acidic vomit, and sometimes destroy the chitincrawler at the same time.  Unfortunately, the safe forests, full of giant snails, attracted goblins.
- MindElder stopped the goblin incursions by forcing them to swear oaths to capture or kill lawbreakers, including other goblins.  Soon, he had an army of law-abiding, healthy goblins, hunting the giant snails, and growing into hobgoblins.  He feared the day that they ran out of giant snails to eat, because goblin hunger can break any enchantment.
- MindElder began to kill goblins, through enchanted sleep, and by rallying his children to kill them.  This did not work well, and many elves died.
- MindElder created a new deal with the goblins, where those who ate enough to grow into hobgoblins would enter a pit, and fight each other for the prize: a giant snail.  This created a much larger problem: ogres, with ogre-sized appetites.
- Killing the ogres would remove all hope from the goblins, and cause another rebellion.  MindElder had to give them hope, so he sent the ogres into an enchanted sleep, and allowed the goblins to place them into stone monuments with tiny crawlspace-tunnels, so the ogres can breathe, and the goblins can check on them.
- The sound of goblin chatter, elven children playing, and high-pitched birdsong would often wake the ogres from their sleep.  With the growing number of ogre-stuff monuments, MindElder could see no option but to ban all high-pitched noises.
    * Starlings, robins and other high-pitched birds, he enchanted to stop singing.  As a result, the region has no birds except crows, ravens, and a few high-flying predators.
    * Goblins must speak in a deep voice whenever they approach the monuments.
    * Jokes are banned (they make the goblins giggle).
    * Farting is also banned (it makes the goblins giggle more than the knock-knock jokes).
