\sidequest[oathtower,sunway,shadepaths,plateauGardens,ravencops]{The \Glsfmttext{ranger}}

If the troupe tarry too long, the \gls{jotter} will send \gls{dickhead} out to find out what's happening.

\sqpart{sunway}% AREA
{An Old Acquaintance}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{dickhead} arrives to scope out the situation}% SUMMARY

The troupe find him in the woods, hunting \pgls{griffin} nest.
He moves towards them quietly, hoping to get the jump on them, just to show off his superior stealth \glspl{skill}.

Once out, \gls{dickhead} speaks haughtily of his ability to survive in the forest, and moves with confidence.
He asks the troupe what they've seen, but does not give their stories much importance.

\begin{speechtext}
  So you still have not found the heart of the problem.
  Well keep searching!
  You may not succeed, but it makes for good practice.
\end{speechtext}

\Gls{dickhead} soon leaves, telling everyone not to follow him, as they'll just make noise.

\sqpart{shadepaths}% AREA
{Peeping Woodsman}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{dickhead} explains his plan to kill \glsfmttext{LifeElder}}% SUMMARY

\Gls{dickhead} has observed the area for some time, noticed the \gls{disgnome} plants, and believes that the giant snails all stem from a single source: a powerful spellcaster.

\begin{speechtext}
  The plan is simple, I kill the \gls{witch}.
  Elves are always wrapped up in their own thing; they never pay attention, and they're probably drowsy from all the \gls{disgnome} in the area.
  So I'll set \pgls{ambush} then loose an arrow on whoever crafts these giant snails.

  Elves are small.
  I'll just need one arrow.
\end{speechtext}

\Gls{dickhead} will leave the \glspl{pc}, as he does not trust them to stay silent while he plans \pgls{ambush} for \gls{LifeElder}.

\sqpart{plateauGardens}% AREA
{Loose Clothing}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{dickhead}'s crossbow lies abandoned on the ground}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  You don't get to be centuries old without learning how to spot \pgls{ambush}.
  As \gls{LifeElder} performed one of her standard spells to query the living things in the area, she found \gls{dickhead}, and guessed the reason for his hiding.
  Her spell has split his limbs into myriad tentacles, leaving his equipment on the ground.
  He slithered away as the spell took hold, confused and dismayed, dropping pieces of his equipment along the way.
\end{exampletext}

The find his \gls{crossbow} and twelve quarrels on the ground, but carrying it sends a clear signal to the elves that they approve of his methods, and makes them dangerous.
They will suffer a -3~Penalty to social rolls with the elves while the \gls{crossbow} is visible.

If the \glspl{pc} follow the trail, have them roll \roll{Wits}{Survival} (\tn[10]).
Success means you can skip to the next \gls{segment}, below.
A tie means they succeed, but only after \pgls{interval} (and another \gls{segment}).

\sqpart{ravencops}% AREA
{Wandering Hood}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{dickhead}'s clothes lie discarded on the ground}% SUMMARY

The troupe see the last of the ranger's clothing, discarded just before entering the forest.
Following him further will not be easy; the \gls{tn} rises to~14.

\sqpart{oathtower}% AREA
{\squash~Retirement}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{dickhead} now works for \glsfmttext{MindElder} as a mutated servant}% SUMMARY

The next time the troupe enter \gls{oathtower}, they find \gls{dickhead} in his new form -- a twisted creature, with limbs replaced by tentacles, and his neck so shrunk that his shoulder-blades wrap around his ears.

After \gls{LifeElder} twisted his body, \gls{MindElder} twisted his mind.
He now accompanies \gls{MindElder} everywhere, passing him pens, and washing his clothes in the lake outside.
When \gls{dickhead} has nothing to carry, he ascends \gls{oathtower} by grabbing a window from outside, and pulling himself up the wall.
Each time he passes a window, he takes a good look inside to check that nobody inside is breaking any laws, and that everything seems as it should.
