\sidequest[Shadepaths,plateauGardens,Ravencops]{The \Glsfmttext{ranger}}

If the troupe tarry too long, the \gls{jotter} will send a ranger out to find out what's happening.

\sqpart{Ravencops}% AREA
{An Old Acquaintance}% NAME
{The \glsfmttext{ranger} arrives to scope out the situation}% SUMMARY

The troupe find him in the woods, hunting a griffin nest.
He speaks haughtily of his ability to survive in the forest, and moves with confidence.
He asks the troupe what they've seen, but does not give their stories much importance.

\begin{speechtext}
  So you still have not found the heart of the problem.
  Well keep searching!
  You may not succeed, but it makes for good practice.
\end{speechtext}

\sqpart{plateauGardens}% AREA
{Peeping Woodsman}% NAME
{The ranger explains his plan to kill \gls{LifeElder}}% SUMMARY

The \gls{ranger} has observed the area for some time, noticed the \gls{disgnome} plants, and believes that the giant snails all stem from a single source: a powerful spellcaster.

\begin{speechtext}
  The plan is simple, I kill her.
  Elves are always wrapped up in their own thing; they never pay attention, and she's probably drowsy from all the \gls{disgnome} in the area.
  So I'll set an ambush then loose an arrow on whoever crafts these giant snails, or slit his throat.
\end{speechtext}

The \gls{ranger} will leave the \glspl{pc}, as he does not trust them to stay silent while he plans an ambush for the \gls{LifeElder}.

\sqpart{Shadepaths}% AREA
{Loose Clothing}% NAME
{The ranger's crossbow is found on the ground}% SUMMARY

\begin{speechtext}
  You don't get to be centuries old without learning how to spot an ambush.
  As \gls{LifeElder} performed one of her standard spells to query the living things in the area, she found the ranger, and guessed the reason for his hiding.
  Her spell has split his limbs into myriad tentacles, leaving his equipment on the ground.
  He slithered away as the spell took hold, confused and dismayed, dropping pieces of his equipment along the way.
\end{speechtext}

The find his crossbow and twelve quarrels on the ground, but carrying it sends a clear signal to the elves that they approve of his methods, and makes them dangerous.
They will suffer a -3~Penalty to social rolls with the elves while the crossbow is visible.

If the \glspl{pc} follow the trail, have them roll \roll{Wits}{Survival} (\tn[10]).
Success means you can skip to the next \gls{segment}, below.
A tie means they succeed, but only after \pgls{interval} (and another \gls{segment}).

\sqpart{Sunway}% AREA
{Wandering Hood}% NAME
{The \glsfmttext{ranger}'s clothes lie discarded on the ground}% SUMMARY

The troupe see the last of the ranger's clothing, discarded just before entering the forest.
Following him further will not be easy; the \gls{tn} rises to~14.
