# The Mission

- (Broch) Trailing basilisk
- (Broch) New mission, while they see the distant Oathttower.
- (Roads) Traders, half-dead, speak of the curse.

# The Dreamers

- (Roads) Temple of Sickness literalist.
- (Bailey) Nobody wants to sleep near the PCs. See a distant broch.  Locals say it's cursed.
- (Roads) Literalist returns

# Sleep of the Just

- (Dream) Troupe get pre-rolled dream.  Introducing the laws.
- (Dream) It happens again - roll!  Introduce random scenarios.

- Talking to someone means you are where they are.
- You can move anywhere as an action.
- FP = HP
- Str = Int, Dex = Wits, Spd = Cha
- Each Skill counts as a Sphere (some are High Spheres).

Each location is two things:

1. A PC's home bailey.
2. First mission location.
3. Infinite spire.
4. The Bastion of Law.
5. The place the troupe fell asleep.
6. On a giant snail.

The law-breaker is two things:

Str/ Int: -1
Dex/ Wts: -1
Spd/ Cha: -1

1. Screaming, starving, goblin (wants to eat like a pig)
2. Ally (lists out disappointments)
3. Bogwitch (helpful advice)
4. Seneschal who stole a book of laws (thief)
5. Piper (plays wrong)
6. Gambler (cheats at dice)

The monster begins as a shadow in the distance, but every rule broken makes it stronger:

Str/ Int: 0
Dex/ Wts: 0
Spd/ Cha: 0

1. (Do not murder) Gnashing teeth. (+3 Str/ Int and +2 Damage)
2. (Speak no ill) Screaming curses. (+3 Dex/ Wts and screaches deal 1 Damage to all in earshot)
3. (Do not steal) Leader of the Sun Guards (+3 Spd/ Cha and +3 DR)
4. (Stay clean) Poison breath  (+3 Str/ Int and ranged attack of 1D6 Damage)
5. (Sing in key) Screaching harpy (+3 Dex/ Wts and screaches deal 1 Damage to all in earshot)
6. (Do not lie) Blinding fog (+3 Spd/ Cha and +3 DR)

The lord of dreams is one thing, and he stands in the distance.

# Into the Dream

People can move into each others' dreams
(ask each player what the next dreams of).
The solution lies in moving into the monster's dreams.

- Fights with Wishmaster.
- First humans landing in area.
- Children leaving home.
- Out of the tower.
