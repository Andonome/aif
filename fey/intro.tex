\subsection*{Good News!}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  You have an adventure module for \gls{bind}.
  \item
  The module has bespoke rules \vpagerefrange{glosPreamble}{glosPostamble}.
  \item
  Minified rules are at the back, as a single sheet of A4, which you can fold into an A7 booklet.
  \item
  It has giant snails!
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Bad News!}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The module has never been play-tested.
  \item
  It doesn't have any pre-generated characters.
  \item
  It definitely won't work as a one-shot, or as an introduction to \gls{bind}.
  \item
  I wouldn't play it if I were you.
\end{itemize}
