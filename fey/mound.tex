\section{Mound}

So we have a tunnel, which takes you right there, although it did have a problem recently\ldots

- We had a rat problem,
- so we put \pgls{crawler} down there,
- but it didn't come out, so we lured this basilisk to use its poisonous breath to kill anything in the hole,
- but the basilisk crawled in once it finished.

So...do you think you can help?
