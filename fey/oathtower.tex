\section{\Glsfmttext{oathtower}}
\label{oathtower}

\Gls{oathtower} stands six storeys tall in the centre of a shining lake.
People can see the tower's top for miles around wherever the tree coverage is not too thick.

Nobody near \gls{oathtower} can breathe in the local mana, because mana always heads towards the largest vacuum.
And since \gls{MindElder} spends so many \glsentrylongpl{mp} each day, he usually has the most missing by the end; so everything flocks towards him, leaving the air feeling stagnant even in a storm.

\subsection{The Lake}

\noindent
Whistling cane grows around the South side of the lake, giving it an eerie sound whenever the wind blows.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{whistlingCane}
The elves use it to make paper, while the hobgoblins use it as an instrument.

\begin{boxtext}
  The \gls{oathtower}'s tall, wooden, door has an identical shade of grim-brown to its stone walls.
  The tower stands a stone's throw away, at the centre of a shining lake.
  A single, short, figure in a green tunic stands in a boat by the tower.
  Her ears are long, her skin maggoty-white, and her eyes full of suspicion.
\end{boxtext}

\subsubsection{Parley with the Boat Goblin}
is the only means of communication with \gls{oathtower}, and takes \pgls{interval}.
She will row across, listen to the \glspl{pc}, and then respond to \emph{every} question with ``\textit{I dunno\ldots I'll ask}''; then she rows back to \gls{oathtower}, walks up the stairs (the \glspl{pc} see her passing by a window), asks \gls{MindElder}, then returns with the reply.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} ask for a weapons licence,}
then that means `one licence', and they receive one each, based on what's visible.
However, they are still breaking the law if they have more than one \gls{weapon}.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} leave without clearly attempting to follow local laws,}
\gls{MindElder} will step onto his balcony, and begin casting offensive spells.

\subsection{Stony Spiral}

The tall structure's stone floor, wooden doors, pitch torches, and loitering hobgoblins give the false impression of a classic `dungeon'.
However, everyone in \gls{enchantedLands} keeps their promises, so they have no need for currency, or locks.
Every door opens at a push, but the only chests contain bottles of brandy or hobgoblin underwear, waiting to be washed.

\subsubsection{The entrance door}
leads to a hall with a staircase and three doors.

\begin{description}
  \item[The ground floor]
  has a grand hall with two doors and a spiral staircase.

  In the centre of the hall, $1D6$ hobgoblins sit with a deck of cards, debating the importance of rules in games.
  The hobgoblin guards have \gls{armour} made from \pgls{basilisk}'s hide \gls{covering} their torso, and a mottled-brown helmet made from the shell of a giant snail.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    $1D6$ hobgoblins mending a boat for the lake around \glsfmttext{oathtower}.
    \item
    Hobgoblin weapon storage, with $1D6 \times 2$ shortswords.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item[The first floor]
  has a massive kitchen with two storage rooms at opposite sides.
  $1D6$ elves debate politely, but their words hide fierce insinuations about how the others once burnt an egg, or used the wrong type of wood for cooking snail meat.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Light supplies, with $1D6 \times 3$ torches, and $1D6 \times 4$ candles.
    \item
    Meat storage, with $1D6$ meals' of \gls{crawler} eggs in salt, $1D6$ meals of snail-meat, $1D6$ meals' worth of vegetables (half of them gigantic and stolen by goblins from the garden plateaus), and $1D6$ meals of auroch meat.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item[The second floor]
  has an open room, full of cushions, with $1D6-3$ elves lounging.
  These elves have taken so many oaths that they are practically incapable of action, and need goblins to tend to them daily.

  The spiral staircase ends here.
  One door and two entrances sit behind the elves -- both open but gloomy.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Behind the door, an in-house outhouse which empties into the lake below.
    \item
    The first alcove houses a small study, with books on poetry, and fantastical erotica where rabbits ride foxes to battle snakes.

    The bookcase serves as a ladder to room \ref{MindElderRoom}, above.
    \item
    A cupboard of \glspl{ingredient}, including $1D6-3$ \gls{woodspy} beaks (Water \glspl{ingredient}), $1D6-3$ \gls{crawler} spinnerets (Fate \glspl{ingredient}), and $1D6-3$ phials of human blood (also Fate \glspl{ingredient}).

    The cupboard lifts back to reveal stairs up to room \ref{RomeoRoom}, above.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item[The third floor]
  has two rooms, accessible only from hidden entrances, below.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    \Gls{MindElder}'s bedroom has a balcony, a bed with white sheets, and nothing else.\label{MindElderRoom}
    \item
    \Gls{romeo}'s bedroom has three books on poetry placed randomly around the room; each of them discuss the importance of a Mathematical underpinning.\label{RomeoRoom}
  \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\Glsfmttext{MindElder}'s Routine}
begins at dawn, as he casts spells to learn about the kinds of minds wander his domain (`\textit{does anyone have hurtful plans?  Does anyone think about theft?}').
Over the day, goblins continuously visit him to renew their oaths (to uphold the laws about theft, and high-pitched noises) so that he can enchant the oaths and keep the goblins honest.
If \gls{MindElder} still has any \glsentrylongpl{mp} left by the evening, he practices new spells.

  \item[Player 1:]
  Okay, so the elf at the quarry asked us to deliver this letter, and showed he knows some kind of levitation spell, now this elf is growing floating plants.
  Is she the one?
  \end{description}
}{
  The eye of the story moves North, and finds a stone \gls{sepulchre}.
  Then it moves West and finds a quarry, surrounded by giant snails.
  The land seems full of life, because the \glspl{sq} from \autoref{elvenForests} place the living things in front of the players.
