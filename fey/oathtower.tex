\section{\Glsfmttext{oathtower}}

Whenever \gls{MindElder} casts spells, he begins absorbing the \glspl{mp} in the \gls{region} around \gls{oathtower}.
\Glspl{mp} always go towards the largest vacuum, and when \gls{MindElder} has cast all he can, he has a vacuum of 12~\glspl{mp}.
Anyone who needs less than 12~\glspl{mp} receives nothing -- \gls{MindElder} takes the lot.

If anyone in the troupe manages to regenerate \pgls{mp} while near \gls{oathtower}, \gls{MindElder} will know that someone is `taking the wind from his sails', and begin looking for them through goblin search-parties and spells.
Once he locates them, he sends an enchanted letter, asking them to leave.

\Gls{oathtower} stands in a lake, with reeds growing from it.
The local elves use the reeds to make paper.

\begin{boxtext}
  The tall, wooden, door has an identical shade of grim-brown to stone walls of the tall tower.
  The tower stands a stone's throw away, at the centre of a lake, brimming with leaves.
  A single tall figure in a green tunic stands in a boat by the tower.
  Her ears are long, her skin maggoty-white, and her eyes full of suspicion.
\end{boxtext}

The door inside leads to a hall with a staircase and three doors.
Each storey is identical, so if the \glspl{pc} enter a door, roll to determine what's inside the first three storeys:

\begin{dlist}
  \item
  $1D6$ hobgoblins with a deck of cards, debating the importance of rules in games.
  \item
  $1D6$ hobgoblins mending a boat for the lake around \Glsfmttext{oathtower}.
  \item
  Hobgoblin weapon storage, with $1D6 \times 2$ shortswords.
  \item
  A kitchen with $1D6$ elves.
  They debate politely, but their words hide fierce insinuations about how the others once burnt an egg, or used the wrong type of wood for cooking snail meat.
  \item
  Light supplies, with $1D6 \times 3$ torches, and $1D6 \times 4$ candles.
  \item
  Meat storage, with $1D6$ meals' of \gls{crawler} eggs in salt, $1D6$ meals of snail-meat, $1D6$ meals' worth of vegetables (half of them gigantic and stolen by goblins from the garden plateaus), and $1D6$ meals of auroch meat.
\end{dlist}

Storeys 3, 4 and 5 have different contents:

\begin{dlist}
  \item
  A small study, with books on poetry, and fantastical erotica where rabbits ride foxes to battle snakes.
  \item
  A cupboard of \glspl{ingredient}, including $1D6-3$ woodspy beaks (Water \glspl{ingredient}), $1D6-3$ \gls{crawler} spinnerets (Fate \glspl{ingredient}), and $1D6-3$ phials of human blood (also Fate \glspl{ingredient}).
  \item
  A lounge, with $1D6-3$ elves lounging.
  These elves have taken so many oaths concerning good behaviour that they are practically incapable of action, and need goblins to tend to them daily.
  \item
  A toilet which empties into the lake below.
  \item
  \gls{romeo}'s bedroom (with three books on poetry placed randomly around the room).
  \item
  \gls{MindElder}'s bedroom (with a balcony, a bed, and nothing else).
\end{dlist}
