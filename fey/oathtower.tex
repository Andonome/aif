\section{\Glsfmttext{oathtower}}
\label{oathtower}

\Gls{oathtower} stands six storeys tall in the centre of a shining lake.
People can see the tower's top for miles around wherever the tree coverage is not too thick.

Nobody near \gls{oathtower} can breathe in the local mana, because mana always heads towards the largest vacuum.
And since \gls{MindElder} spends so many \glsentrylongpl{mp} each day, he usually has the most missing by the end; so everything flocks towards him, leaving the air feeling stagnant even in a storm.

\subsection{The Lake}

\noindent
Whistling cane grows around the South side of the lake, giving it an eerie sound whenever the wind blows.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{whistlingCane}
The elves use it to make paper, while the hobgoblins use it as an instrument.

\begin{boxtext}
  The \gls{oathtower}'s tall, wooden, door has an identical shade of grim-brown to its stone walls.
  The tower stands a stone's throw away, at the centre of a shining lake.
  A single, short, figure in a green tunic stands in a boat by the tower.
  Her ears are long, her skin maggoty-white, and her eyes full of suspicion.
\end{boxtext}

\enchantedGoblin[\npc{\F\N}{Boat Goblin}]

The door inside leads to a hall with a staircase and three doors.
Each storey is identical, so if the \glspl{pc} enter a door, roll to determine what's inside the first three storeys:

\begin{dlist}
  \item
  $1D6$ hobgoblins with a deck of cards, debating the importance of rules in games.
  \item
  $1D6$ hobgoblins mending a boat for the lake around \Glsfmttext{oathtower}.
  \item
  Hobgoblin weapon storage, with $1D6 \times 2$ shortswords.
  \item
  A kitchen with $1D6$ elves.
  They debate politely, but their words hide fierce insinuations about how the others once burnt an egg, or used the wrong type of wood for cooking snail meat.
  \item
  Light supplies, with $1D6 \times 3$ torches, and $1D6 \times 4$ candles.
  \item
  Meat storage, with $1D6$ meals' of \gls{crawler} eggs in salt, $1D6$ meals of snail-meat, $1D6$ meals' worth of vegetables (half of them gigantic and stolen by goblins from the garden plateaus), and $1D6$ meals of auroch meat.
\end{dlist}

\hobgoblin

The hobgoblin guards have \gls{armour} made from \pgls{basilisk}'s hide \gls{covering} their torso, and a mottled-brown helmet made from the shell of a giant snail.

Storeys 3, 4 and 5 have different contents:

\null
\begin{dlist}
  \item
  A small study, with books on poetry, and fantastical erotica where rabbits ride foxes to battle snakes.
  \item
  A cupboard of \glspl{ingredient}, including $1D6-3$ woodspy beaks (Water \glspl{ingredient}), $1D6-3$ \gls{crawler} spinnerets (Fate \glspl{ingredient}), and $1D6-3$ phials of human blood (also Fate \glspl{ingredient}).
  \item
  A lounge, with $1D6-3$ elves lounging.
  These elves have taken so many oaths concerning good behaviour that they are practically incapable of action, and need goblins to tend to them daily.
  \item
  An in-house outhouse which empties into the lake below.
  \item
  \gls{romeo}'s bedroom (with three books on poetry placed randomly around the room).
  \item
  \gls{MindElder}'s bedroom (with a balcony, a bed, and nothing else).
\end{dlist}

\subsubsection{\Glsfmttext{MindElder}'s Routine}
begins at dawn, as he casts spells to learn about the kinds of minds wander his domain (`\textit{does anyone have hurtful plans?  Does anyone think about theft?}').
Over the day, goblins continuously visit him to renew their oaths (to uphold the laws about theft, and high-pitched noises) so that he can enchant the oaths and keep the goblins honest.
If \gls{MindElder} still has any \glsentrylongpl{mp} left by the evening, he practices new spells.
