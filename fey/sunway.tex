\subsection{\Glsfmttext{plateauGardens} Walls}

\begin{boxtext}
  \Gls{sunway} comes to a harsh stop at a wall of perfectly vertical, and strangely solid, earth.
  It stands half as tall as \pgls{broch}, and tree-branches sway even higher up, their roots poking a crown around the edges.

  The great wall continues down this Sunlit part of the sparse forest farther than you can see, in both directions.
  But it also has crevices, or cracks, or some darkness dotted along it.
  Through one crack, the silhouette of a half-dead tree droops down the wall half way.
\end{boxtext}

The raised plateaus of the \gls{plateauGardens} form this wall, and the cracks which separate the gardens are \gls{shadepaths}.
Dangling foliage lets bear-light elves clamour up, but heavier people risk breaking the delicate foliage.

\paragraph{When someone climbs,}
they roll $1D6 + \gls{weight}$; a roll of 12 or more breaks the branch (or root, or vine) and they tumble down, and hit the ground four \glspl{step} below, while earth or plants dislodge and falls on them after the fall.

The total Damage is 2 plus the character's Strength%
\exRef{core}{Core}{falling}
and everyone standing close receives the die just rolled as Damage too.
