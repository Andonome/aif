\section{\Glsfmttext{sunway}}
\label{sunway}

At the border between the two lands the trees grow thin.
Bushes dominate, grasses grow, and small circles of Sunlight form where the canopy breaks.
The \gls{sunway} cuts a line across many miles, providing easy passage for aurochs, who help widen the passage every time they pass, by eating young trees and stamping down everything they can.

Here at last, \pgls{witch} can breathe easily.
\Glspl{mp} regenerate at the normal rate.

\subsection{\Glsfmttext{plateauGardens} Walls}

\begin{boxtext}
  \Gls{sunway} comes to a harsh stop at a wall of perfectly vertical, and strangely solid, earth.
  It stands as tall as \pgls{broch}, and tree-branches sway even higher up, although no roots stick out of the earth anywhere.

  The great wall continues down this Sunlit part of the sparse forest farther than you can see, in both directions.
  But it also has crevices, or cracks, or some darkness dotted along it.
\end{boxtext}

Travelling along the great wall reveals low paths which go between the high places, and into \gls{shadepaths}.

Half a dozen goblins occasionally arrive with ropes, or climbing equipment, to enter \gls{plateauGardens} above and take some food.
Initially, they asked for the food, but \gls{LifeElder} explained that `property is a construct of your mind'.
Some thought the carrots might be illusions, but they still tasted great, and nobody owned them, so the goblins began to take them.
