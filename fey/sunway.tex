\section{\Glsfmttext{sunway}}
\label{sunway}

At the border between the two lands the trees grow thin.
Bushes dominate, grasses grow, and small circles of Sunlight form where the canopy breaks.
\Gls{sunway} cuts a line across many miles, providing easy passage for aurochs, who help widen the passage every time they pass, by eating young trees and stamping down everything they can.

Here at last, \pgls{witch} can breathe easily.
\Glspl{mp} regenerate at the normal rate.

\subsection{\Glsfmttext{plateauGardens} Walls}

\begin{boxtext}
  \Gls{sunway} comes to a harsh stop at a wall of perfectly vertical, and strangely solid, earth.
  It stands half as tall as \pgls{broch}, and tree-branches sway even higher up, their roots poking a crown around the edges.

  The great wall continues down this Sunlit part of the sparse forest farther than you can see, in both directions.
  But it also has crevices, or cracks, or some darkness dotted along it.
  Through one crack, the silhouette of a half-dead tree droops down the wall half way.
\end{boxtext}

The raised plateaus of the \gls{plateauGardens} form this wall, and the cracks which separate the gardens are \gls{shadepaths}.
Dangling foliage lets bear-light elves clamour up, but heavier people risk breaking the delicate foliage.

\paragraph{When someone climbs,}
they roll $1D6 + \gls{weight}$; a roll of 12 or more breaks the branch (or root, or vine) and they tumble down, and hit the ground four \glspl{step} below, while earth or plants dislodge and falls on them after the fall.

The total Damage is 2 plus the character's Strength%
\exRef{core}{Core}{falling}
and everyone standing close receives the die just rolled as Damage too.

\sqpart[\gls{vlg}]{sunway}% AREA
{Elven Steps}% NAME
{A hidden path leads to \glsfmttext{plateauGardens} above}% SUMMARY
\label{hiddenStairs}

In the causeway between the \gls{ravencops} forest and the \gls{plateauGardens}, a single plateau has a hidden stairway, going up.
\Glspl{crawler} cannot make much use of the narrow stairs, with occasional hand-holds for little fingers.
People who don't know about the stairs cannot usually see them, as every step blends into the tall rock-face from below.
But once someone notices the first step, they see the next, and then the next, and so on.

\paragraph{Spotting the rocks}
requires a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll at \tn[12].
The \gls{tn} increases by~+1 in the rain, and by~+3 at night.

\sqpart[\gls{vlg}]{sunway}% AREA
{Sunlit Glyphs}% NAME
{Elven glyphs, carved in wood, describe a song of ritual magic}% SUMMARY
\label{sunwayGlyphs}

\begin{exampletext}
  \Gls{juliet} began coming here to practice using the Force \gls{sphere} through ritual songs, and carved the notes into local trees to remember them.
  Years later, \gls{romeo} found the patch of glyphs and felt fascinated.
  So little by little, he taught himself the songs, and the rituals of the Force \gls{sphere}.

  And eventually, he began to carve his own glyphs, adding to her songs, or copying them with variation.
\end{exampletext}

\histEvent{45}{4}{%
  \Glsfmttext{juliet} begins carving song-rituals of the Force \gls{sphere} into a patch of trees in \glsfmttext{sunway}%
}

\histEvent{40}{3}{%
  \Glsfmttext{romeo} finds \glsfmttext{juliet}'s song-ritual glyphs, and slowly learns the Force \glsentrytext{sphere} from them%
}

\begin{boxtext}
  The dusky Sunlight makes little rune-shadows across the glyphs carved into all the surrounding trees.
\end{boxtext}

The elves who pass through here don't notice the glyphs because they normally ride giant snails.
The goblins who pass through here don't notice the glyphs, because they don't care.

\paragraph{Understanding the glyphs}
requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Academics} roll.

\begin{boxtable}

  \textbf{Roll} & \textbf{Result} \\\hline

   6 & These glyphs mean musical notes.  \\

   7 & \ldots and a few words in Elvish.  \\

   8 & Two people carved them.  \\

   9 & The `lyrics' pertain to Fire.  \\

  10 & \ldots and Earth.  \\

  11 & They form a magical ritual.  \\

  12 & Actually, they make many rituals.  \\

  13 & The rituals are of the Force \gls{sphere}.  \\

  14 & The ritual won't work without the missing words.  \\
