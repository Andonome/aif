\epigraph{
  There was an old lady who swallowed a goat;

  Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!

  She swallowed the goat to catch the dog,

  She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,

  She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,

  She swallowed the bird to catch the spider

  That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her,

  She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;

  I don't know why she swallowed a fly – perhaps she'll die!
