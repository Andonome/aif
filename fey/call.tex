  There was an old lady who swallowed a fly,

  I don't know why she swallowed a fly,

  Perhaps she'll die!

Named after the crown of copper spikes along its outer wall, and the ring of walnut trees around the farmland perimeter, this little \gls{village} holds 100 humans, out here at the \gls{edge}.
They struggle to survive, as \glspl{monster} attack while they farm, and crawl over the houses at night, trying to find an opening.
Over the last few years, many have contracted diseases such as Mindflash Syndrome, or Guardbane.%

However, the \gls{village} benefits from being close to \gls{ravencops}.
Not a single \gls{monster} has come from that forest, until today.
