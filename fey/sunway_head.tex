At the border between the two lands the trees grow thin.
Bushes dominate, grasses grow, and small circles of Sunlight form where the canopy breaks.
\Gls{sunway} cuts a line across many miles, providing easy passage for aurochs, who help widen the passage every time they pass, by eating young trees and stamping down everything they can.

Here at last, \pgls{witch} can breathe easily.
\Glspl{mp} regenerate at the normal rate.
