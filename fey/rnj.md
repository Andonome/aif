# Oathless Lovers

Romeo and Juliet love each other, but Romeo only understands love as an oath to be kept, while Juliet only understands oaths as an insult and a violation.
If the PCs nudge them together, the two soon form a plan to meld the two elven lands into one, with a dramatic spell which will destabilize the land, and bring all other threads to a conclusion.

The dramatic plan
requires Ingredients.
It requires sixteen in total:

- 4 Earth Ingredients
- 4 Fire Ingredients
- 4 Water Ingredients
- 4 Fate Ingredients

(Garden) Daisy Chain
-----
{Juliet makes a daisy chain, and thinks of contacting Romeo}

A dozen elves spot clouds, describing what the clouds look like, and telling stories about the exploits of the 'cloud-willow', and the 'cloud-river'.
They think in terms of moving forests, and complete species, rather than individuals.

Juliet takes no interest, and makes a daisy chain instead, and secretly thinks of giving it to Romeo.

If the PCs suggests Juliet has an interest in Romeo publicly,
she denies it casually.

> Oh, that one?  With all the oaths?  Well I can't swear I would never, however...

The elves laugh, and they forget about the idea moments later.

But if the PCs ask Juliet secretly,
she confirms she likes him, then hands over the daisy-chain, in case they see him again.

(Oathtower) Proxy Chains
-----
{MindElder tells Romeo, 'there is no love without an oath'}

MindElder has no respect for anyone's privacy, and has been casting Witness Mind spells to figure out why his son, Romeo, seems to detached lately.
Once he found the answer, he felt enraged, and began to argue with Romeo about the character of the unruly elves in the great plateau gardens.

>>>
An angry voice echoes from the tower, then another.
Fast, bitter words in Elvish ring out, then the tower goes silent.
>>>

Romeo eventually leaves through the tower's front door.
He feels angry, but has accepted his father's idea: "love means nothing without an oath".

The PCs may try to change his mind, but it won't be easy.

> Why is she so committed to avoiding an oath of love?

> Why would you refuse an oath of love if you don't plan on violating the oath?

> If I can promise to love her, shouldn't she reciprocate?  Do I have more duties than she?

> Why does she never wear clothes?  What's wrong with those people?

If the PCs can provide rational answers, Romeo calms down and starts thinking clearly.

If the grand plan has already begun,
Romeo reveals he has collected one Ingredient of each type required (Earth, Fire, Water, and Fate) from a storage room in the Oathtower.
The plan requires twelve more Ingredients in total.

(Causeway) Stop That Snail!
-----
{Juliet says, 'stop that snail!'}

Juliet rode on a giant snail (with a carrot-on-a-crane attached to the top of its shell), playing a flute, then hopped off to chat with friends, and lost track of time.

The snail has escaped into the causeway, along with the flute, and Juliet doesn't like the idea that MindElder might spot it, and make it carnivorous.

> Stop that snail!

If the PCs try to get Juliet to meet with Romeo,
they can roll Charisma + Empathy, TN 5.

If the two have already met, and the plan is underway,
then Juliet will already have collected another Ingredient of each type (sourced from various gardens), and tells the troupe what she has.

(Ravencops) Wherefore
-----
{A dozen goblins hunt for Romeo}

Romeo left his father's lands, to search among the garden plateau for Juliet.
MindElder has sent out bands of goblins to find his location, and report back.

Majiscule leads six other goblins through the woods.
Soon they will reach the plateau gardens.
The goblins speak frankly with the troupe about their mission, and will not deviate from it, even for a moment, unless their lives are in danger.

If the grand plan has begun,
then Romeo will have used this time to collect one more Ingredient of each type required.
