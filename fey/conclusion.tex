\section{Considerations}

\begin{exampletext}
  Can you name the nameless one?

  Can you shoe a snail?

  Would you write a letter only from the moss?

  Can you barter with a song, with one who treasures dross?

\subsection{No Way Home}

If you want to run this arc over multiple sessions, or if the troupe find themselves stuck here over \gls{downtime}, the elven lands have plenty of reasons for characters to leave, disappear or get distracted.

\subsubsection{In \gls{plateauGardens}}

Characters leave because,

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  they ate the wrong thing, and their limbs shrivelled.
  The elves hope to fix them `soon' (and will, once the player returns).
  \item
  they wandered off with an elf (leading to gossip and laughter), and have not returned.
  The next session resumes once all hope is lost for finding them.
  \item
  a clerical error resulted in an immediate summoning from an overseer.
  A new \gls{pc} arrived to deliver the letter.
\end{enumerate}

Characters arrive because,

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  the \gls{jotter} wants to know what the hold-up is.
  \item
  the \gls{pc} was lost, some time ago.
  Hunger and monsters killed the rest of their troupe.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{In the pale forest}

Characters leave because,

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  they whistled out of key, and the goblins told them it was time to leave.
  \item
  \pgls{ogre} woke up, her hand reached out, and she grabbed the character.
  \gls{MindElder} reacted quickly, putting everyone in enchanted sleep, but she holds the character like a child with a doll; best not to wake them.
  \item
  goblins prepared food for Winter, grabbing all that was edible, and stuffing it in ice.
  The `it' included the character, who is `edible'; but the \gls{MindElder}'s enchanted sleep spell should deep them safe.
\end{enumerate}

Characters arrive because,

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  twelve oathkeeper goblins caught them in the forest, along with a bear and \pgls{griffin}.
  The goblins take their prizes -- all tied to poles -- back to share with the rest.
  \item
  the local overseer sent the character with a letter for \gls{MindElder}.
  It contains a generic proposal for mutual aid in killing beasts.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Fall of an Ecosystem}

If \gls{LifeElder} stops producing food for the snails, they will leave the area, and provide huge amounts of food for the goblins, who will all feast and grow rapidly.
