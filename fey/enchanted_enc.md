{Giant snail devours chitincrawler in acid attack}

When giant snails barged into the area, MindElder decided to kill two birds with one stone, and twisted their little minds to crave flesh.
The giant snails stalk the woods, looking for some meat to eat with their leaves, and occasionally find a chitincrawler.

>>>
The echo of a distant crow's cry reaches you, just before dying.
The trees look a kind of uniform-brown, without any mottling or variation.
And the road feels as smooth as pond-scum.
>>>

The troupe should make a banding action to not fall over while walking on freshly-laid snail tracks: Dexterity + Athletics (TN 7).
Failure inflicts 1 EP.

>>>
You find a cross-roads, as the path splits left and right.
The road to the left looks older, and less slimy, but has a chitincrawler running towards you.
The road to the right also looks old, until the giant snail, approaching silently.
>>>

If the PCs  are near the giant snail when it sprays acid, they can roll Wits + Survival (TN 7) to leap into the woods as the snail prepares to spray.

>>>
As the snail-spittle hits the trees and bushes in a messy gush, they let of a tiny hiss and begin to wilt.
Leaves wither and bark turns black.
Behind, the chitincrawler turns to flee into the woods with two left-legs melded together.
>>>

If the troupe let the situation unfold, the giant snail ignores them, and chases the wounded chitincrawler up a tree.

(Ravencops) Got a Permit, Mate?
-----
{An oathkeeper goblin asks the troupe if they have a licence for their weapons}

>>>
The lack of chitincrawlers and plentiful giant snails soon brought a lot of goblins to the area.
MindElder also turned this problem to his advantage by making the goblins swear to capture or kill anyone disturbing the peace.

The goblins responded with sarcasm, but the spell worked anyway, soon all the goblins lay dead or agreed to take oaths of good behaviour, which work fine as long as the goblins eat regularly.
>>>

>>>
In the distance, a small person in a long, green cloak walks towards you, carrying a potato so large that it cannot see you.
A long nose points up, just above the top of the potato, and pasty-white ears flop at shoulder-length.
>>>

If the goblin (Abjad) sees the troop, it switches the potato to a one-arm hold and points accusingly at the troupe, then speaks in an unusually deep voice.

>>>
I hope you got a licence for those weapons!
Show me!
Show me the licence, earless scum!
>>>

The Abjad (the goblin) observes and insists on the following local laws:

- No high-pitched noises.
- No jokes, nor words which move to laughter.
- No unlicensed weapons.
- No singing out-of-lock.
