# Multiple Sessions

If you want to run this arc over multiple sessions, the elven lands have plenty of reasons for characters to leave, disappear or get distracted.

## In the plateau gardens

Characters leave because,

1. they ate the wrong thing, and their limbs shrivelled.  The elves hope to fix them 'soon' (and will, once the player returns).
1. they wandered off with an elf (leading to gossip and laughter), and have not returned.  The next session resumes once all hope is lost for finding them.
1. a clerical error resulted in an immediate summoning from an overseer.  A new PC arrived to deliver the letter.

Characters arrive because,

1. the jotter wants to know what the hold-up is.
1. the PC was lost, some time ago.  Hunger and monsters killed the rest of their troupe.

## In the pale forest

Characters leave because,

1. they whistled out of key, and the goblins told them it was time to leave.
1. an ogre woke up, her hand reached out, and she grabbed the character.  MindElder reacted quickly, putting everyone in enchanted sleep, but she holds the character like a child with a doll; best not to wake them.
1. goblins prepared food for Winter, grabbing all that was edible, and stuffing it in ice.  The 'it' included the character, who is 'edible'; but the MindElder's enchanted sleep spell should deep them safe.

Characters arrive because,

1. twelve oathkeeper goblins caught them in the forest, along with a bear and a griffin.  The goblins take their prizes - all tied to poles - back to share with the rest.
1. the local overseer sent the character with a letter for MindElder.  It contains a generic proposal for mutual aid in killing beasts.

# Fall of an Ecosystem

If LifeQueen stops producing food for the snails, they will leave the area, and provide huge amounts of food for the goblins, who will all feast and grow rapidly.
