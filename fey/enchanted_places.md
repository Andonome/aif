(Oathtower) Groaning Ziggurats
-----
{The troupe must walk quietly and avoid the groaning ziggurats}

Goblins have no natural height limits, so when they eat too much, they just grow and grow, until one day, without any clear cut-off point, people call them a 'hobgoblin', and soon after, 'ogre'.

When the goblins become ogres, MindElder puts them into an enchanted sleep, and tells the goblins their big brothers will awaken when the time of grand feasting comes.

The goblins must see the sleeping ogres from time to time, or they will suspect murder and betrayal, and even their oaths will not keep them passive.
Hunger and murder can break even the MindElder's enchanted oaths, and high-pitched noises will wake the sleeping ogres.

>>>
Past the trees, an arrow's flight away, a mossy tower stands as tall as a feasting hall turns on its end.
A low groaning noise, like a distant earthquake, floods through the trees, surrounding you.
>>>

The tower has a lot of ziggurats dotted around it, often hidden by trees, and always with little paths leading towards them.
Each one has three ogres, cramped in together.
They stand as wide as a cottage, but not as tall, and the sound of snoring emanates for a few hours each day.

High-pitched noises near the tower
have a 1 in 6 chance of waking an ogre.
The chances increase by 1 for loud noises, or noises closer to the ziggurats.

In order to avoid waking the ogres, MindElder has told the goblins to slay anyone making high-pitched noises, such as whistling or laughing.
Farting is also banned, as it makes the goblins giggle, which then wakes the ogres.
