Each \gls{segment} in this \gls{sq} shows an area within \gls{plateauGardens}, and the \gls{sq} `continues' as long as the troupe remain in the \gls{area}.
You should note each piece on the map, so that when the troupe return, they find the same place again.

\Gls{juliet} has cultivated these flowers using the Force \gls{sphere}.
The flowers of enlightenment make you light, making it easier to carry things; but first they must wilt and go brown.

  A bed of bright-red flowers, with long petals like the floppy ears on a dog.

\sqpart[\gls{vlg}]{plateauGardens}% AREA
{Drooping Bean Vines}% NAME
{Bean vines on a tree provide a route down}% SUMMARY

The bridge-vines don't always grow into bridges.
This one just climbed a tree, which is now covered in bean-producing vines.

\paragraph{If the troupe pull the long vines down,}
they can safely descend to \gls{shadepaths} below.
However, leaving the vines there means creatures below can crawl up; so if the troupe use the vines to descend, the next time they arrive here, they see \pgls{crawler} ascending to the plateau garden, and assaulting anyone there.
