\section{\Glsfmttext{ravencops}}
\label{ravencops}

\Gls{ravencops} received its name from the guttural bird-calls in the area.
Despite being a verdant forest, it feels bleak, and has little edible food.
All attempts at \gls{foraging} are at \gls{tn}~14.

\Gls{oathtower} sucks up most of the \glspl{mp} in the surrounding \gls{region}, which makes the air feel thin.
Unless \pgls{witch} is missing 6~\glspl{mp} or more, they can only receive 2~\glspl{mp} at the end of \pgls{interval}.%

  \Gls{LifeElder} loved the little paths snails make, and wanted to walk across them, but she was too big.

    Can we stand on that?

    Take it easy with \pgls{restingaction}, and set a die to six, now roll the other one.

    The trees obscure the tower, so you can't see which way gets you closest to the tower right now, but you can see a giant arachnid crawling forward as deep-brown as the trees, it looks nearly as tough.
    It spots you and sprints, front-legs raised.

    As you run back, the crawler gallops towards you like a horse, but as it rounds the corner, brownish-green liquid sprays onto it.
    It collapses into a ball, and two of its hind legs melt together.

    (Sinkmaul)
    Is it dead?

    It uncurls, and moves into the forest, as the snail pursues it, belching the acid to clear its path.

\sqpart[\gls{vlg}]{oathtower}% AREA
{Groaning Sepulchres}% NAME
{The troupe must walk quietly and avoid the groaning sepulchres}% SUMMARY

\histEvent{20}{2}{%
  \Glsentrytext{MindElder} finds the goblins overpopulating the area, and fears the day they run out of food; even the most powerful enchantments cannot withstand goblin hunger.
  He rewards loyal goblins with obscene amounts of food, which lets them grow and grow, into hobgoblins, and eventually into \glsfmtplural{ogre}.
  Trials include service in \glsfmttext{oathtower}, hunting dangerous creatures, and plenty of duels (which really helps reduce the population).
  Once the goblins ascend, \glsentrytext{MindElder} places them in an enchanted sleep inside a stone sepulchre (where the goblins can check on them)}

\begin{exampletext}
  Goblins have no natural height limits, so when they eat too much, they just grow and grow, until one day, without any clear cut-off point, people call them a `hobgoblin', and soon after, `\gls{ogre}'.

  When the goblins become \glspl{ogre}, \gls{MindElder} puts them into an enchanted sleep, and tells the goblins their big brothers will awaken when the time of grand feasting comes.
  The goblins must see the sleeping \glspl{ogre} from time to time, or they will suspect murder and betrayal, and even their oaths will not keep them passive.

  So the forest around \gls{oathtower} has slowly filled up with snoring sepulchres, and everyone must tread quietly, lest they wake and ask for breakfast\ldots
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}
  Past the trees, an arrow's flight away, a mossy tower stands as tall as a feasting hall turns on its end.
  A low groaning noise, like a distant earthquake, floods through the trees, surrounding you.
\end{boxtext}

\Gls{oathtower} has a lot of sepulchres dotted around it, often hidden by trees, and always with little paths leading towards them.
Each one has three \glspl{ogre}, cramped in together.
They stand as wide as a cottage, but not as tall, and the sound of snoring emanates for a few hours each day.

\paragraph{High-pitched noises near \gls{oathtower}}
have a 1 in 6 chance of waking \pgls{ogre}.
The chances increase by 1 for loud noises, or noises closer to the sepulchres.

In order to avoid waking the \glspl{ogre}, \gls{MindElder} has told the goblins to slay anyone making high-pitched noises, such as whistling or laughing.
Farting at any pitch is also banned, as it makes the goblins giggle, which then wakes the \glspl{ogre}.

{Goblins in the Quarry}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{romeo} should be working, but needs to complete the perfect poem}% SUMMARY
\label{goblinQuarry}

\Gls{MindElder} has sent his son \gls{romeo} to oversee the goblins, excavating rock at the quarry, and cutting long slabs to construct more sepulchres.
But \gls{romeo} can't think of anything but the poem he needs to write, to tell his beloved how how he feels.
Unfortunately, his father raised him to be a perfectionist, which means he can't write perfect poetry, or good poetry, or bad poetry, or any poetry at all.

\begin{speechtext}
  What rhymes with snail?
  Mail, sail, bail\ldots hay-bail?
  Are hey-bails a thing?
  But `hey' is too informal.
  Better to say `hello'.
  `Hello-bail'\ldots no it sounds non-committal.
\end{speechtext}

So he stands looking at a blank sheet of paper, while twenty goblins ignore him, and bicker about pick-axes and the proper way to use a cart.

\begin{boxtext}
  In the near-distance, around this corner (or possibly two), someone, or something, is hitting metal on rocks.
  The metal sounds strange, butt probably iron.
  The rocks give that satisfying crack that rocks give with a long, clean cut.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} ask about the poem's recipient,}
\gls{romeo} explains he has no idea whom he loves, so he can only describe their mind.

\begin{speechtext}
  A quick wit, and very insightful in material matters -- able to tell the weight of a stone, bird, or an entire tree just by looking at it.
  And a deep critical thinker, not in any malicious sense, but nevertheless with cutting questions, whenever the need arises.
  This someone has wisdom beyond their years, though I don't know how old they might be, but still I'm sure of it\ldots

  I read their writing, and learned so much.
  They taught me how to move, and how things move.
  We write back and forth, we know each other so well.

  \ldots and yet, I cannot describe a face.
  But what's a face?
  Who cares?
  I just want to explain how I feel, and marriage to seal the deal.

  `Seal the deal'\\
  `An oath would make me less morose\ldots'

\end{speechtext}

\gls{romeo} does not know whom it's for, and explains he learned from his teacher by reading, and fell in love utterly.
His father doesn't approve of the `oathless' types, and he feels ashamed of loving such an `air-headed' person, despite all she's taught him.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} help him with the poem,}
then he perks up and quickly finishes it, then asks them if they might try to find the recipient.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} do nothing,}
\gls{romeo} remains at the quarry, thinking of the perfect words.

\paragraph{If the troupe commit crimes,}
the goblins will ignore them as long as they can.
They have taken an oath to dig rocks, and they will continue to dig until something shakes them from their oath.

\romeo

\showStdSpells

\paragraph{As the troupe leave,}
they notice \gls{romeo} using the Force \gls{sphere} to make the goblins' rocks lighter.%
\footnote{This tells the \glspl{pc} that \gls{romeo} understands the Force \gls{sphere}, which indicates a link to \gls{juliet}.
This becomes important later, in \nameref{oathlessLovers}, \vpageref{oathlessLovers}.}

\sqpart[\gls{vlg}]{sunway}% AREA
{Elven Steps}% NAME
{A hidden path leads to \glsfmttext{plateauGardens} above}% SUMMARY
\label{hiddenStairs}

In the causeway between the \gls{ravencops} forest and the \gls{plateauGardens}, a single plateau has a hidden stairway, going up.
\Glspl{crawler} cannot make much use of the narrow stairs, with occasional hand-holds for little fingers.
People who don't know about the stairs cannot usually see them, as every step blends into the tall rock-face from below.
But once someone notices the first step, they see the next, and then the next, and so on.

\paragraph{Spotting the rocks}
requires a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll at \tn[12].
The \gls{tn} increases by~+1 in the rain, and by~+3 at night.

\sqpart[\gls{vlg}]{ravencops}% AREA
{The Icebox House}% NAME
{Underground elves live to guard food packed in ice}% SUMMARY
\label{iceboxHouse}

\histEvent{130}{3}{%
  With the old lich killed, \glsfmttext{MindElder} decided to settle down, build the perfect tower, and raise perfect children in a perfect land.
  Unfortunately, the children stole, fought, and disobeyed his orders to stay at home and keep safe.
  He made them all swear oaths to uphold the law, never harming any elf, nor taking property, nor singing out of key.
  Without the ability to sing out of key, none have learnt to sing, but this turned out to be an improvement, as \glsfmttext{MindElder} always enjoyed silence more than song%
}

Thick, glass tiles, a full step wide, pepper the land; these tiles are the roof-windows of elven houses.%
\exRef{stories}{Stories}{elvenGlades}
Smoke rises from a chimney, which juts out through a tree.
Three tall trees surround and hide a stone stairway, leading down to a little door.
Three short taps permits entry.

\begin{boxtext}
  One elf takes water, and whispers gently until the water sleeps, and turns to ice.
  Another prepares a little food, using a rapier's broken-off tip as a knife.
  The rest of the rapier remains mounted on the wall, above the fire; but these elves have no use for weapons.
  Harming people causes pain, and they have promised not to harm anyone.
\end{boxtext}

A little goblin sleeps in a hammock, muttering in his sleep.
`\textit{Carapace pies, tentacle-fry\ldots}'
The elves will have something cooked for him by the time he wakes, and then he must fetch more water, using the ornate bucket, carved from carapace, with an abstract map of the land chiselled around its side.

\elf

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} ignore the smoking chimney,}
that's fine.
This \gls{segment} does not advance any plot, and there is nothing the \glspl{pc} need to do.
This \gls{segment} exists simply because elves live in \gls{enchantedLands}, and they will greet guests who knock on their door in a friendly manner, and start telling long, boring stories.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} inspect the bucket-map}
they receive a +2~Bonus to all \gls{navigation} checks within the surrounding \glspl{area}.

\paragraph{If they ask for help,}
they receive it, as long as they make small, reasonable requests.

\paragraph{If they ask questions,}
the elves answer happily.
They know most of the history of the area (find the summary \vpageref{chronologicalEvents}).

\sqpart[\squash\gls{vlg}]{ravencops}% AREA
{Subtle Sepulchres}% NAME
{Most goblins have forgotten about these \glsfmtplural{ogre}}% SUMMARY

\Gls{MindElder} ordered this sepulchre made before he understood how easily the dreams of \glspl{ogre} break.
It houses three, who snore quietly.

\sqpart[\gls{vlg}]{ravencops}% AREA
{The House of Grand Stories}% NAME
{Underground elves tell painless stories in perfect rhythm}% SUMMARY

Beehives buzz around a flowery garden.
Three large boulders (which look quite out of place) hide stairs down to a long hall, where perfect elves tell perfect stories of perfect people.
The stories rhyme in a precise pattern, and follow the hero's journey exactly.
The characters in the stories do no wrong, and have no fights, because fighting hurts people, and the storytellers never think about hurting people.

The elven home has three chambers, for three elves, and a central area for cooking.
Goblins occasionally visit, bringing supplies of snail-meat and stolen vegetables.
The various cupboards also have $1D6-3$ of the following items:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Smoked meats (usable as a day's \glspl{ration}).
  \item
  Stormy moonlight from a storm, captured in a large, glass, phial (usable as a Water \gls{ingredient}).
  \item
  Auroch hooves (usable as an Earth \gls{ingredient}).
\end{itemize}

\elf

\end{multicols}

\sqpart[\gls{vlg}]{ravencops}% AREA
{Lake Rancid}% NAME
{The old lake has become a bog}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  \Gls{sunderedForest}'s malformed ground rerouted a river which once fed this lake.
  Since then, it became stagnant, then a basin for giant snails to bathe, shit, and mate.
  Soon after, even the snails stopped coming.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}
  Not far ahead, a stench.
  It is the most basic and generic stench, the intersection of every standard stench.
  The pure, basic form of stench.

  The surrounding trees seem healthy, but extra dark.
\end{boxtext}

If the \glspl{pc} instigate \pgls{flood} inside \gls{sunderedForest}, it travels through this swamp, replenishing it, bringing the lake back to life, and throwing the stench through \gls{ravencops} and beyond.
