(Garden) Interview with the Tao Mistress
-----
{LifeQueen wanders the canals, all answers seem strange}

> Possessions are just things.  Don't let your things control you - be free!

> Everything comes, if you wait the right way.

> Endings have nothing to do with what happens, they come from values.

> Order to the spider is chaos to the fly.


(Gardens) Enlightenment
-----
{The flowers of the garden of light make you float}

Juliet has cultivated these flowers using the Force Sphere.
They flowers of enlightenment make you light, and let you float.

(Garden) Mist Below
-----
{The Canals fill with mist, only eyestalks roam above}


(Garden) Disgnome Blooms
-----
{The mind-rending plant hides with the tomatoes}

A tiny prick from the needle-tips can slow someone's mental capacity, making them feel like everyone around them is babbling fast-paced nonsense, and makes the day seem to last an hour.
A number of the elves have been affected, but they blame their headaches and confusion on enchantments or don't even consider the cause.

If the troupe destroy the plants, SnailTamer soon returns to his natural human-paced thinking.

(Canals) The Picnic Choir

{Elven songs above, but nobody responds}


(Canal) Mist Abounds
-----
{The troupe see nothing, but hear something}

Check the next Side Quest in the Canal, or even in the Garden.
What would it sound like, if someone couldn't see it?

(Causeway) Misty Way
-----
{The mists fill the causeway}

The PCs can see nothing in the causeway, as mist hangs low.
They may have to make a navigation roll just to move about, and projectiles suffer double the normal range penalties.

# The Ranger

If the troupe tarry too long, the jotter will send a ranger out to find out what's happening.

(Ravencops) An Old Acquaintance
-----
{A ranger arrives to scope out the situation}

The troupe find him in the woods, hunting a griffin nest.
He speaks haughtily of his ability to survive in the forest, and moves with confidence.
He asks the troupe what they've seen, but does not give their stories much importance.

>>>
So you still have not found the heart of the problem.
Well keep searching!
You may not succeed, but it makes for good practice.

(Garden) Peeping Woodsman
-----
{The ranger explains his plan to kill LifeQueen}

The ranger has observed the area for some time, noticed the disgnome plants, and believes that the giant snails all stem from a single source: a powerful spellcaster.

>>>
The plan is simple, I kill her.
Elves are always wrapped up in their own thing; they never pay attention, and she's probably drowsy from all the disgnome in the area.
So I'll set an ambush then loose an arrow on whoever crafts these giant snails, or slit his throat.

(Ravencops) An Arrow to the Knee
-----
{LifeQueen has cast a spell to shrink the ranger}

The ranger moves faster now,
and has been forced into an oath.
