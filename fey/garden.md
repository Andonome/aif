(Garden) Interview with the Tao Mistress
-----
{LifeQueen wanders the canals, all answers seem strange}

> Possessions are just _things_, man.  Don't let your things control you - be free!

> Everything comes, if you wait the right way.

> Endings have nothing to do with what happens, an ending is ultimately a manifestation of values.

> If it never rained, the plants wouldn't grow.

> Order to the woodspy is chaos to the fey.

> You have this obsession with 'good' and 'bad', but where is this 'good'? What colour is 'bad'?


(Canals) The Picnic Choir
-----
{Elven songs descend from the plateau above}

A little group of elves sing, but don't respond to shouts or calls.
They will, however, respond to someone singing with them.

If someone sings well, they will lower the vines of a broken bridge to help them up.
If they sing poorly, the elves leave silently.

Singing PCs should roll Intelligence + Performance to understand the elven song, and imitate it.

(Garden) Mist Below
-----
{The Canals fill with mist, only eyestalks roam above}

Mist always falls into the canals by the plateau gardens.
The disorienting environment is quite lethal to newcomers, as people who don't know where the land lies can easily make a misstep, tumbling down the sides.

>>>
Mist has risen, but is falling into the canals beside the plateau gardens.
Soon the canals look like fluffy-white rivers.
A figure in the distance seems to hover between two plateau gardens, but the walking reveals they must be on a vine-bridge which has fallen just below.
>>>

Fast movements require a Wits + Survival roll (TN 8) to avoid falling into the misty canals below.
Longer journeys require an Intelligence + Survival roll (TN 10).

The mists fade after an Interval.

(Causeway) Misty Way
-----
{The mists fill the causeway}

The PCs can see nothing in the causeway, as mist hangs low.
They may have to make a navigation roll just to move about, and projectiles suffer double the normal range penalties.

# The Ranger

If the troupe tarry too long, the jotter will send a ranger out to find out what's happening.

(Ravencops) An Old Acquaintance
-----
{A ranger arrives to scope out the situation}

The troupe find him in the woods, hunting a griffin nest.
He speaks haughtily of his ability to survive in the forest, and moves with confidence.
He asks the troupe what they've seen, but does not give their stories much importance.

>>>
So you still have not found the heart of the problem.
Well keep searching!
You may not succeed, but it makes for good practice.
>>>

(Garden) Peeping Woodsman
-----
{The ranger explains his plan to kill LifeQueen}

The ranger has observed the area for some time, noticed the disgnome plants, and believes that the giant snails all stem from a single source: a powerful spellcaster.

>>>
The plan is simple, I kill her.
Elves are always wrapped up in their own thing; they never pay attention, and she's probably drowsy from all the disgnome in the area.
So I'll set an ambush then loose an arrow on whoever crafts these giant snails, or slit his throat.
>>>

The ranger will leave the PCs, as he does not trust them to stay silent while he plans an ambush for the LifeQueen.

(Garden) Loose Clothing
-----
{The ranger's crossbow is found on the ground}

>>>
You don't get to be centuries old without learning how to spot an ambush.
As LifeQueen performed one of her standard spells to query the living things in the area, she found the ranger, and guessed the reason for his hiding.
Her spell has split his limbs into myriad tentacles, leaving his equipment on the ground.
He slithered away as the spell took hold, confused and dismayed, dropping pieces of his equipment along the way.
>>>

The find his crossbow and twelve quarrels on the ground, but carrying it sends a clear signal to the elves that they approve of his methods, and makes them dangerous.
They will suffer a -3 Penalty to social rolls with the elves while the crossbow is visible.

If the PCs follow the trail, have them roll Wits + Survival (TN 10).
Success means you can skip to the next Segment, below.
A tie means they succeed, but only after an Interval (and another Segment).

(Canals) Discarded Clothing
-----
{Rangers clothes lie discarded on the ground}

The troupe see the last of the ranger's clothing, discarded just before entering the forest.
Following him further will not be easy; the TN rises to 14.


# The Movements of Monsters

(Canals) Excuse Me!
-----
{A giant snail blocks the path}

'Brownie' the snail grew much bigger than the others, and pregnancy did not help.
Now when the moves through the canals, she blocks them entirely.
Anyone walking inside the canals must simply turn back and find another route.
This may delay the troupe in whatever they wanted to do by an Interval.

If the troupe try to squeeze past her, have them roll Dexterity + Stealth at TN 8.
Failure inflicts 2D6 Damage as her massive body smooshes them against the canal walls.

(Causeway) Stampede
-----
{An auroch stampede passes through}

Elves watch from a garden plateau as aurochs stampede through the causeway.
Behind them, a chitincrawler chases, but it's losing steam, and soon retreats into the forest.

(Garden) Woodspy Spotted
-----
{A woodspy stalks the garden}

Most large animals have trouble reaching up the tall walls to the plateau gardens, but woodspies are clever, and sometimes manage to pull themselves up using a snail, or finding a piece of vine hanging down.

Any elves present will probably spot the creature.
Either way, it slowly meanders towards an exit path, and waits for someone to pass.
Once it grabs someone, it pulls them down into the canyon.

(Causeway) Slow Wander Home
-----
{The aurochs are returning...slowly}

Any sudden movement will prompt the aurochs to begin a stampede away.
The troupe may prefer to wait, but this will take the rest of the Interval, as the aurochs move slowly, while grazing.

# The Emerging Landscape

When the story's camera moves West, we see a detailed garden.
If the camera moves South, it may find a shining lake, surrounded by giant snails.
When the camera zooms in, it finds the mottled texture of discarded shells and small elven footprints.
But the camera has been tricked; the landscape is not really full of life, it seems that way because the turf is laid before the camera moves.

Each Segment of this Side Quest shows an area within the garden plateaus, and the segment 'continues' as long as the troupe remain in the Area.
You should note each piece on the map, so that when the troupe return, they find the same place again.

(Garden) Disgnome Blooms
-----
{The mind-rending plant hides with the tomatoes}

A tiny prick from the needle-tips can slow someone's mental capacity, making them feel like everyone around them is babbling fast-paced nonsense, and makes the day seem to last an hour.
A number of the elves have been affected, but they blame their headaches and confusion on enchantments or don't even consider the cause.

If the troupe destroy the plants, SnailTamer soon returns to his natural human-paced thinking (not great, but better than most elves).

(Gardens) Enlightenment
-----
{The flowers of the garden of light make you float}

Juliet has cultivated these flowers using the Force Sphere.
The flowers of enlightenment make you light, and let you float; but first they must wilt and go brown.
The decaying process requires two Intervals of Sunlight, after which someone can eat the plants.
Doing so reduces their Weight by 5.

>>>
A bed of bright-red flowers, with long petals like the floppy ears on a dog.
It looks like someone made space for them, and spent a lot of time on their soil bed.
