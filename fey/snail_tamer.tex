{Debating Parsnips}% NAME
{\Glsentrytext{SnailTamer} meanders home, wondering if he should make parsnip or potato soup}% SUMMARY

\Gls{SnailTamer} has missed a turn-off in the maze of canyons, and can't remember which direction he's going.
However, he's more concerned with the question of what kind of soup he should make once he returns home.

\begin{boxtext}
  A mile breeze blows.
  A voice in the distance sounds like it's practising Elvish vocabulary, and you recognize the word for `parsnip'.
  Around the corner, \gls{SnailTamer} appears, as naked as the Sun, then stops and stares, as if trying to recognize you.
\end{boxtext}

\begin{speechtext}
  So, like.  Guys?  Yea, you guys.  Okay then.  So we don't make people do things here, no laws about fabrics over your body -- you just walk about however you like, okay?

  Potatoes are always great, but you can't eat potatoes all day.
  It's been ages since I had parsnip soup actually.
  Once I get home I'll have a large bowl of soup, then take that soup-nap where you're just full of soup and curl up on your hammock.
  You know that one?
  Soup-naps are great.
\end{speechtext}

\Gls{SnailTamer} continues meandering and mumbling until someone snaps him out of it.
If \pgls{pc} makes a clear request help getting out of the canyon and onto the plateau, he agrees, says `\textit{let's go then}', and starts walking while whistling a sad song.
Soon enough, an elf in one of the raised gardens will hear him, and lower a few ripe bean-vines.

The bean-vines can take a total \gls{weight} of 10.
The \glspl{pc} can gauge the weight limit with an \roll{Intelligence}{Survival} roll at \tn[8].

{\glsentrysymbol{vlg}~Shell Escape}% NAME
{Giant potato sprouts vomit from \gls{SnailTamer}'s house, it may fall any moment!}% SUMMARY

If you leave potatoes in a bag with a little Sunlight, they will grow arms and try to find earth to implant themselves into.
Giant, magical, elf-potatoes are entirely normal in this regard, but much bigger.

\begin{boxtext}
  Across the next bean-vine bridge, a giant snail-shell stands, dangerously close to falling into the canyon.
  Sunlight shines through the shell, displaying an upper floor with a desk, hammock, some cloaks, and jars.

  Pale tendrils push out the door, then have a hard twist down into the earth, like a limb trying to grasp the ground.
\end{boxtext}

Anything the \glspl{pc} do may push the house over the edge, and into \gls{shadepaths}.

\paragraph{Get an item from the house:}
\roll{Dexterity}{Stealth} at \tn[12] (+1 per item).

\paragraph{Righting the house, so it will not fall over:}
\roll{Strength}{Cultivation}, \tn[12].

\paragraph{Using the vines to secure the house:}
\roll{Intelligence}{Cultivation}, \tn[10].

\paragraph{If the troupe wait long enough,}
\gls{SnailTamer} will arrive (in the next \gls{segment}), and he will see what has become of his house.
Whether or not his house survived, he will need a `walk-nap', to recover from his walk.

{Choosing a Shell}% NAME
{\glsentrysymbol{day}~\Glsentrytext{SnailTamer} to pick a new snail}% SUMMARY

\Gls{SnailTamer} needs to pick a new snail so he can get about safely, but he can't decide which snail is best.
One seems too unbalanced for him to put the wooden carrot-rod onto, another looks `too old', then the next is pregnant (which will cause problems before long).
So he just sits there, beside his long wooden rod and a small leaf-sack of oversized vegetables (usable as 3 days' \glspl{ration} after cooking).

\begin{boxtext}
  The sky clears, revealing bright blue.
  \Gls{SnailTamer} sits on a ledge not far away, overlooking \gls{shadepaths}.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If \gls{SnailTamer} still suffers from the \gls{disgnome} stings,}
the \glspl{pc} can usher him along with a \roll{Charisma}{Cultivation} roll at \tn[10].
Otherwise, he'll pick a snail within \pgls{interval}.

\paragraph{Once \gls{SnailTamer} has a new mount,}
he attaches the `leading rod' with a cork-screw, then takes another nap.

\begin{speechtext}
  The screw doesn't hurt the snail as long as you don't go too deep.
  It's just like shoeing a horse.

  What a big day, eh?
  Well, I'm going to have a top-back-nap, and dream up a name.
  Snails don't need labels, but they also don't object to them!

  Top-back-naps are the best, because you never know where you'll wake up.
\end{speechtext}

{Urgent Delivery}% NAME
{\glsentrysymbol{day}~\Glsentrytext{SnailTamer} races to deliver a letter on snail-back}% SUMMARY

\Gls{LifeElder} was bound to send `her most reliable messenger', and that's \gls{SnailTamer}.
He's not the fastest, or well-spoken, nor is he routinely sure of where he is.
However, he has delivered two messages, which means his success rate is $\frac{2}{2}$, and 100\%.

So she charged him with delivering the letter to \gls{MindElder}, and he's finally en route.

\begin{boxtext}
  Crashing trees interrupts the patter of rain.
  In the distance, through the sparse forest, a giant snail has stopped to feed on the vegetation.
  The rider wears a giant primrose hat, and sits by a long stick with a potato on the end.
\end{boxtext}

\sqpart{oathtower}% AREA
{The Letter of the Law}% NAME
{\glsentrysymbol{afternoon}~\Glsfmttext{SnailTamer} wants someone else to deliver the letter, so he can avoid any binding enchantments}% SUMMARY

At \gls{oathtower}, \gls{SnailTamer} has changed his mind about entering, and decided to hide behind his new mount.
This plan would have worked well, except for the large wooden pole mounted on the snail's back, indicating that it has a rider.

\begin{boxtext}
  Mist obscures the pasture, and \gls{oathtower}.
  The lake has vanished from view.
  To the left, in the distance, another path through the forest has a giant snail, with a long stick attached to the top of its shell.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} agree to deliver the letter,}
\gls{SnailTamer} hands his satchel, which feels dank and smells musty, as it's full of moss.

\begin{speechtext}
  Thanks for taking the satchel up.
  That big tower -- it just scares me, all that nasty, tight, energy wrapped up in one hideous pile of rocks.

  Time I lie down, gather some energy with a tactical-nap.

  You know what they say, yea?
  There's a nap for everything.
\end{speechtext}

Once opened, the moss is in the shape of the letter `F' (which is the letter \gls{LifeElder} wanted to send).
