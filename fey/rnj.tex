\sidequest[plateauGardens,ravencops,oathtower,sunway]{Oathless Lovers}
\label{oathlessLovers}

\Gls{romeo} and \gls{juliet} have never met, but still managed to fall in love.
Unfortunately, \gls{romeo} only understands love as an oath to be kept, while \gls{juliet} only understands oaths as an insult and a violation.
If the \glspl{pc} nudge them together, the two soon form a plan to meld the two elven lands into one, with \pgls{spell} so powerful it will destabilize the land, and bring all other threads to a dramatic and confusing conclusion.

\paragraph{Once the two unite,}
they discuss the grand spell, and request the \glspl{pc} help them gather the necessary \glspl{ingredient}.
They need sixteen in total:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  4 Earth \glspl{ingredient}
  \item
  4 Fire \glspl{ingredient}
  \item
  4 Water \glspl{ingredient}
  \item
  4 Fate \glspl{ingredient}
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampletext}
  We want to unite the lands, making all one, a single people and place.
  This \gls{spell} will reframe everyone's problems into a memory.
\end{exampletext}

The couple won't be able to expand on the spell, except in abstract terms (`united, entirely', `the grand crossing of perspective').
See \vpageref{grandSpell} for how the spell goes off.

\sqpart{sunway}% AREA
{Sunlit Glyphs}% NAME
{Elven glyphs, carved in wood, describe a song of ritual magic}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  \Gls{juliet} began coming here to practice using the Force \gls{sphere} through ritual songs, and carved the notes into local trees to remember them.
  Some years later, \gls{romeo} found the patch of glyphs and felt fascinated.
  So little by little, he taught himself the songs, and the rituals of the Force \gls{sphere}.

  And eventually, he began to carve his own glyphs, adding to her songs, or copying them with variation.
\end{exampletext}

\histEvent{45}{4}{%
  \Glsfmttext{juliet} begins carving song-rituals of the Force \gls{sphere} into a patch of trees in \glsfmttext{sunway}%
}

\histEvent{40}{3}{%
  \Glsfmttext{romeo} finds \glsfmttext{juliet}'s song-ritual glyphs, and slowly learns the Force \glsentrytext{sphere} from them%
}

\begin{boxtext}
  The dusky Sunlight makes little rune-shadows across the glyphs carved into all the surrounding trees.
\end{boxtext}

The elves who pass through here don't notice the glyphs because they normally ride giant snails.
The goblins who pass through here don't notice the glyphs, because they don't care.

\paragraph{Understanding the glyphs}
requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Academics} roll.

\begin{boxtable}

  \textbf{Roll} & \textbf{Result} \\\hline

   6 & These glyphs mean musical notes.  \\

   7 & \ldots and a few words in Elvish.  \\

   8 & Two people carved them.  \\

   9 & The `lyrics' pertain to Fire.  \\

  10 & \ldots and Earth.  \\

  11 & They form a magical ritual.  \\

  12 & Actually, they make many rituals.  \\

  13 & The rituals are of the Force \gls{sphere}.  \\

  14 & The ritual won't work without the missing words.  \\

\end{boxtable}

Mark this \gls{area} on the map \vpageref{feylands}.

\sqpart{plateauGardens}% AREA
{\Glsfmttext{juliet}'s Flowers}% NAME
{one dry, each works as a Force \glsfmttext{talisman}}% SUMMARY

A dozen elves spot clouds, describing what the clouds look like, and telling stories about the exploits of the `cloud-willow', and the `cloud-river'.
They think in terms of moving forests, and complete species, rather than individuals.

\Gls{juliet} takes no interest, as she is busy drying her flowers by pressing them onto a rock, then hanging them from a bush.
These are the `flowers of enlightenment', which she grows to make things float.
Check the details \vpageref{flowerOfEnlightenment}.

\juliet

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} look tired,}
\gls{juliet} hands them a flower or two, and just says `\textit{flower of enlightenment, for the weight of the world}' (she doesn't speak the \gls{tradeTongue} well, but anyone who speaks Elvish can clarify).

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} identify \gls{juliet} and deliver the poem,}
(potentially written \vpageref{goblinQuarry}) she reads it slowly, then asks them to accompany her back to \gls{ravencops} to meet with \gls{romeo}, where they begin to plot their perspective-sundering spell (\vpageref{grandSpell}).

\paragraph{If the troupe want to take her, but are not ready yet,}
she simply waits for them at the edge of \gls{sunway}, and meets them in the next \gls{segment}.

\sqpart{sunway}% AREA
{Stop That Snail!}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{juliet} loses control over her favourite snail}% SUMMARY

\Gls{juliet} rode on a giant snail (with a carrot-on-a-crane attached to the top of its shell), playing a flute, then hopped off to chat with friends, and lost track of time.

The snail has escaped into the causeway, along with the flute, and \gls{juliet} doesn't like the idea that \gls{MindElder} might spot it, and make it carnivorous.

\begin{speechtext}
  Stop that snail!
\end{speechtext}

\paragraph{If the two have already met, and the plan is underway,}
then \gls{juliet} will already have collected another \gls{ingredient} of each type (sourced from various gardens), and tells the troupe what she has.

\sqpart{oathtower}% AREA
{Wherefore Not?}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{MindElder} tells \glsentrytext{romeo}, `there is no love without an oath'}% SUMMARY

If \gls{romeo} and \gls{juliet} have not met, skip this \gls{segment}.

\Gls{MindElder} has no respect for anyone's privacy, and has been \gls{casting} \textit{Witness Mind} to figure out why his son, \gls{romeo}, seems so detached lately.
Once he discovered that \gls{romeo} has become infatuated with an unknown elf from the \gls{plateauGardens}, he felt enraged, and began to argue with \gls{romeo} about the character of the unruly elves who live over there.

\begin{boxtext}
  An angry voice echoes from \gls{oathtower}, then another.
  Fast, bitter words in Elvish ring out, then the tower goes silent.
\end{boxtext}

\Gls{romeo} eventually leaves through the tower's front door.
He feels angry, but has accepted his father's idea: ``love means nothing without an oath''.

The \glspl{pc} may try to change his mind, but it won't be easy.

\begin{speechtext}
  Why is she so committed to avoiding an oath of love?

  Why would you refuse an oath of love if you don't plan on violating the oath?

  If I can promise to love her, shouldn't she reciprocate?
  Do I have more duties than she?

  Why does she never wear clothes?
  What's wrong with those people?
\end{speechtext}

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} can provide rational answers,}
\gls{romeo} calms down and starts thinking clearly.

\paragraph{If the grand plan has already begun,}
\Gls{romeo} reveals he has collected one \gls{ingredient} of each type required (Earth, Fire, Water, and Fate) from a storage room in \gls{oathtower}.
The plan requires twelve more \glspl{ingredient} in total.

\sqpart{sunway}% AREA
{Insider Knowledge}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{romeo} hunts for the right \glsfmttext{ingredient}, while talking about the tower}% SUMMARY

\Gls{romeo} has found a spot of \glspl{marchingMushroom}, which he puts his snail-gut satchel.
He has enough for two Earth \glspl{ingredient} so far, and hopes to find more.

\paragraph{If he trusts the troupe,}
he speaks openly to them about the problems in the \gls{enchantedLands}.
Otherwise, he hides.

\begin{speechtext}
  My father has played a dangerous game with all these goblins.
  He controls them only as long as they remain fed, but if they feed, they will breed.
  He sends them to kill dangerous creatures, or bring news from far away, but most survive.
  Every sepulchre with sleeping \glspl{ogre} marks another failure to control the population.%
  \footnote{\Gls{romeo} won't say so, but he holds the same view of local humans, and would destroy \gls{coppernut} and everyone inside if they looked threatening.}

  If the goblins suspected that \gls{MindElder} wants to reduce them, they would begin to push back against their oaths, or simply leave the area, past where he can reach them.

  We do not want that.
  We do not want to see the goblins abandoned, in great number, to their own hunger.
\end{speechtext}

\sqpart{sunway}% AREA
{Change of Plan}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{juliet} has figure out the spell will not work; she needs an artificial \gls{flood}}% SUMMARY

\Gls{juliet} enters \gls{sunway}, studying her old notes, and realizes the plan for the great spell to unite everyone's perspectives across the two lands will not work; she needs \pgls{flood}.
The troupe will have to scout out \gls{shadepaths} to find where the water comes from,%
\footnote{Check the river locations \vpagerefrange{shadePool}{shadeDamn}.}
and engineer \pgls{flood}, perhaps with a damn.

How the \glspl{pc} engineer \pgls{flood} depends on them, but \gls{shadepaths}'s high walls, and secret streams allows them more opportunities than most locations.
Whatever their plan, it should be abstracted to \pgls{natural}; and if the roll fails, they will simply have to change their methods and tools to provide bigger bonuses.

\sqpart{ravencops}% AREA
{The Goblin Hunting Party}% NAME
{A dozen goblins hunt for \glsfmttext{romeo}}% SUMMARY

\Gls{romeo} left his father's lands, to search among the \gls{plateauGardens} for \gls{juliet}.
\Gls{MindElder} has sent out bands of goblins to find his location, and report back.

Majiscule leads six other goblins through the woods.
Soon they will reach \gls{plateauGardens}.
The goblins speak frankly with the troupe about their mission, and will not deviate from it, even for a moment, unless their lives are in danger.

\paragraph{If the grand plan has begun,}
then \gls{romeo} will have used this time to collect one more \gls{ingredient} of each type required.
