      (Sinkmaul)
      Let's jump into the gates.
      \item[\gls{gm}:]
      The people usher you in, pushing the thick wooden gate closed behind you.
      The \gls{village} looks dusky-dim, but active.
      People are rushing out with bundles of arrows in hand, and the \gls{village}'s last two cows are mooing loudly in distress; but the children all know to keep quiet until the danger has gone.
      \item[Player 2:]
      (Mildrain)
      Can we get up to the wall?
      \item[\gls{gm}:]
      You go up the stairs, take $2D6+1$ Damage.
      \item[Player 1:]
      (Sinkmaul)
      Wait, are we both up the stairs?

      No, I can\ldots that's `12 Damage'.

      Okay, so I'm dead\ldots

  }{
    The initial description helps the players picture \pgls{village} under threat, then it all falls apart.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
      The player wanted to know about how people access the wall, because that part of the arrangement was entirely unclear.
      They didn't mention their \gls{pc} actually going up.
      \item
      Responding with `\textit{yes, can get up the wall; do you?}' isn't much better.
      More description always works better.
      \item
      \Glsentrylongpl{pc} should take \pgls{action} before they die, not because `it's fair', but to make certain they're committed.
      Once they cast the dice, responsibility shifts from the \gls{gm} to the player.

    Some miles on, and the Sun's high.
    You keep walking with that `squelch, squelch, squelch' along the snail-path, and spot a potato on the path ahead, held in someone's arms.
    \item[Player 3:]
    (Cleftbarb)
    Hide!

    That's \roll{Wits}{Stealth}, \glsentrylong{tn}~6.

    Okay then\ldots\dicef{6}.
    \item[\gls{gm}:]
    Hiding in the thick darkness which surrounds the road, you wait until the small figure passes, grumbling to himself in the \gls{tradeTongue} about `the sleeping ones'.
    Once silence returns, the march continues, through hours of nearly-identical woodland.
    By the time you approach the tower, it's nearly night, but the dusk's light highlights a stone structure in the forest.
    A long cube, a rumbling stone box.
    \item[Player 2:]
    (Mildrain)
    Ignore!
    \item[Player 1:]
    (Sinkmaul)
    Right, `tower'.
    \item[Player 3:]
    What if it's treasure?

    The road opens, revealing a shining lake, with the tower in the centre\ldots

  }{
    The pacing sped up suddenly as the players hopped through three \glspl{segment} within a couple of minutes.
    The players still received information (giant snails reduce the \gls{monster} population), gained questions (though nobody has actively asked about the source of the giant potato), and have a new location on the map which they might return to.

    That last \gls{segment} with the `stone box' (\gls{sepulchre}) has the `\gls{vlg}' symbol listed next to it.
    This indicates it should go onto the map, with the assumption it's always been there.

  }{\noindent
    This is awful, and the \gls{gm} should be fed to goblins, feet-first.
    If the players say they want to approach `the tower', then the \gls{gm} should describe approaching the tower, or describe what's stopping the \glspl{pc} from getting to the tower (and repeat, until they approach the tower).

    Instead of asking players about `left or right' turns, the \gls{gm} should abstract the entire journey into a roll.
