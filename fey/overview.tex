  \item[The tail begins]
  in \pgls{broch} above \pgls{village}.
  A mysterious tower stands a dozen miles away, in the peaceful \gls{ravencops} forest.
  At dusk, a giant snail emerges from \gls{ravencops} and tries to eat \pgls{village}'s crops.

  \textit{If nobody stops the snails, more will come, destroying the \gls{village}'s crops.}

  \item[In \autoref{elvenForests}]
  the troupe enter \gls{ravencops} to find out where that giant snail came from.
  They find a maze snail-trail roads.

  Within a day, a giant snail approaches, and attacks \pgls{crawler}.

  \textit{This explains why \gls{ravencops} has so few monsters --- the snails keep it safe.}

  \item[Closer to \gls{oathtower}]
  a goblin approaches, demanding to see the troupe's weapons licences.
  If they speak politely, he leads them to \gls{oathtower} to obtain licences.

  \textit{The lord of \gls{oathtower} keeps the goblins under enchanted oaths, so and they enforce the local laws.}

  \item[Near \gls{oathtower}'s shining lake]
  the \glspl{pc} find \pgls{sepulchre}, and something inside snores like an avalanche.
  Their goblin-guide explains that three \glspl{ogre} rest inside, in an enchanted sleep, and they will awaken during the time of feasting.

  \textit{High-pitched noises in \gls{ravencops} will awaken a horde of hungry \glspl{ogre}.}

  \item[The boatman by \gls{oathtower}]
  can give the \glspl{pc} weapons licences, and tell about the snails.

  \textit{The enchanter at the top of \gls{oathtower} makes the snails attack \glspl{monster}, but they come from the West, where `lawless elves' live.}

  \item[To the West]
  they find the earth juts upwards, in tall pillars.
  Elves climb the walls by holding onto the roots of \glspl{disgnome}, but those roots have a venom which dulls their senses, and leaves them lounging in a stupor on the \glspl{plateauGardens}.

  \textit{Without the poisonous roots, the local elves will become alert, and may help the \glspl{pc}.}
  \item[In shadows between the pillars,]
  giant snails roam in \gls{shadepaths}.

  \textit{A nameless elf wanders below.
  She makes the snails grow.}

  \item[The crux]
  arrives when the players consider what levers they have.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Removing the snails means ravenous goblins.
    \item
    Removing the goblins means more snails, and more monsters in \gls{ravencops}, which will travel to human lands.
    \item
    Removing the \glspl{ogre} requires delicacy.
  \end{itemize}
  \item[In \autoref{looseThreads}]
  \autoref{feyClosing}'s little \glspl{thread} cover the dangers of ecological collapse.

  \Glspl{thread} in \autoref{feyClosingThreads} show the daily life of each \gls{region}.

  \item[The end]
  depends on your group.
  Perhaps they kill the giant snails.
  Perhaps they balance another fix on top of the problems, and the world wobbles on.
