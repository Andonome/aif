## Background
- Each time the dragon tries and fails to burp or fart, the pressure builds in his abdomen, then he belches fire.

## Segments

### 1) Strange Noises (Bailey)
- People hear noises sounding...
  - like an asthmatic motorbike.
  - like a newborn thundercloud, squealing.
  - like bedsheets being torn open.
- A jotter orders the PCs to get rid of the noises.

### 2) Murmurs in the Deep (Woods)
- Getting in the direction of the noises and moving against the wind inflicts 1 EP per interval, because the PCs need to move through a dense cloud of toxic and malodour cloud of dragon sickness-farts.
- The roars and farts echo through the cavern. Finding the entrance requires good auditory orientation (maybe multiple entrances exist?) 

### 3) Double Shot (Cavern)
- The dragon suffers from constipations. He can barely move and his only way to release some of the pressure is through uncontrolled belches and farts.
- The lair is filled with a mix of stomach-twisting body gases.
- The dragons ask the PCs to gather laxative mushrooms growing further down the cavern.

### 4) Laxative Mushrooms (Cavern)
- The dragon farts enrich flammable methane inside the cavern.
- The mushrooms are sentient (which effects do they have?)
