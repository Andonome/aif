    For some extra tension, let a character enter the water and then focus on the other players.
    Let the troupe decide how long they will wait, in the darkness, before someone else enters.
    Of course, if the others say `one hour', once you resolve the first character's actions (the one in the black waters), you may find that the troupe did not in fact wait for an hour, as the first character may return after a few minutes to tell everyone how to move through.

      Nothing -- you need to feel.
      The water has a metallic cold, which pulls heat from your skin.

      Which way do you go?
      \item[Player 2:]
      I'll move up.

      You find a sharp, spiky ceiling as you swim up and round.

      Take another \gls{ep}.
      Do you continue?
