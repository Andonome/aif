\sidequest[Town,Mountain,Forest]{Goblin Gossip}

Goblins banish their criminals to the world above, which has earned them a bad reputation.
One such group clambers skyward, and soon begin stealing from nearby \glspl{village}.
The behaviour escalates until they kill a human, and everyone demands the \gls{guard} ascend to slay the lot.
However, goblins can be extremely dangerous on their home turf.

\sqpart{Mountain}% AREA
{Little by Little}% NAME
{Goblins steal milk from \glsfmtplural{village}}% SUMMARY

By the mountain's side (in \pgls{village} or on the road), one farmer shouts about her stolen milk, while the other tries to stop her making accusations.

\begin{boxtext}
  What kind of monster steals milk left outside a house?
  No kind!
  Not a single \gls{monster} which walks, crawls, or flies takes milk.

  Cows?  Yes
  Babies? Absolutely!
  But never \emph{milk}!
\end{boxtext}

There is no way to stop this argument.

\paragraph{Examining the area}
with a \roll{Wits}{Survival} roll at \tn[12] show goblin footprints going up to the mountain.
A Margin of 2 (i.e. \tn[14]) means the \glspl{pc} can trace the goblins back through the forest, and eventually to their mountainous entrance (\vpageref{goblinCaveEntrance}: `\nameref{goblinCaveEntrance}').

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\squash~Cooked Innards}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{smuggler} speaks about the deer bones found in the forest, covered with goblin tracks}% SUMMARY

The \glspl{pc} overhear \gls{smuggler}, shouting about goblin tracks around some half-digested deer bones, close to the mountain.
Everyone in the market wants to know what the \glspl{pc} intend to do about it.

\sqpart{Mountain}% AREA
{\Glsentrytext{afternoon}~Dead Horses}% NAME
{Goblins drop rocks on traders' horses}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  The goblins have discovered a foolproof way to hunt for food.
  They haul large rocks up trees, then along a branch close to the road, and drop the rocks on a trader's horse.

  If one horse dies, the caravan moves on, leaving the goblins a dead horse to eat.
  If more horses die, the caravan never has enough horse-power to pull all the wagons, and has to leave one behind.
\end{exampletext}

As the troupe travel close to the mountain, goblins stand on the treetops, ready and waiting with boulders.
If the \glspl{pc} are with a caravan, the goblins drop rocks on the horses, otherwise, they remain in the shadowy treetops, silently.

Spotting the goblins requires a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll (\tn[10]).
But doing something about the problem requires a plan, because hitting the goblins won't be easy.

If the \glspl{pc} have \glspl{projectile}, one goblin can drop their big rock and take cover each \gls{round}.
On the treetops, 10~\glspl{step} in the air, is \tn[9], but once they take cover the players will have to roll at \tn[11].

\goblin

In addition to the listed rocks, three goblins have a boulder which deals $2D6$ Damage.
However, they can only drop it on someone directly below them.

\sqpart{Town}% AREA
{\squash~Tales of the Goblin Hole}% NAME
{A drunk \glsentrytext{ranger} tells the taverns about finding the goblins' den}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  \Gls{ranger} Snakesqueal has found an entrance to the goblins' mountain lair, but he felt too terrified to enter.
\end{exampletext}

Snakesqueal spends the day wandering taverns, becoming more drunk, and boasting about how he's going to kill every last goblin in the mountain once he's had another drink.
But he always needs just one more drink.

\sqpart{Mountain}% AREA
{Over the Line}% NAME
{Goblins kill a shepherd}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  A shepherd saw goblins trying to disturb his cows, and rushed in to stop them.
  The goblins killed him quickly, then fled.
\end{exampletext}

Every \glspl{village} round the mountain talks about \composeHumanName's death, and all agree the \gls{guard} must sort the problem immediately.

One group of \glspl{fodder} have already gone up the mountain, but haven't returned.
A second group will go out soon.

The next session should begin with \nameref{goblinsBegin}, \vpageref{goblinsBegin}.
