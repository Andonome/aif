{The Stench of Death}% NAME
{The Goblins have massacred a caravan}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}
  Stoatfen~\Gls{bothy} lies ahead, one of the widest \glspl{bothy} around, though very remote.
  Around it, the usual fifty~\gls{step} clearing of
  \ifnum\thetemperature=0%
    snow
  \else%
    dried grass
  \fi%
  provides space to see any dangers coming from the tall, surrounding, forest.
  And something nasty comes on the wind.
  Rotten meat.
  Death from up the road.
\end{boxtext}

\label{missingAxe}
\act{check Stoatfen~\Gls{bothy}}{Intelligence}{Vigilance}{7}
Rolling over means understanding that someone stayed the night a couple of days ago;
the hay is untouched, but the windows are open, and the axe is missing
\ifnum\thetemperature=0%
  but there's plenty of firewood still available.
  The ash indicating a small fire with one person kneeling in front%
\else%
  and the chamberpot has been used once%
\fi.
Rolling under means time wasted to find nothing.

\paragraph{Up the road}
the stench comes from two dead \glspl{guard}.

\begin{boxtext}
  Two wagons and some large rocks block the road.
  Two men lie dead and rotting, next to bits of broken wood, and old mushrooms.
\end{boxtext}

\begin{boxtable}
  2 & Yip, they're dead.  Maybe it was bandits? \\
  3 & These two wagons should have one horse each. \\
  4 & The men died from the boulders being dropped on their heads. \\
  5 & Goblin footprints approached. \\
  6 & A little coin-pouch lies discarded (\lootMedium).\label{discardedCoins} \\
  7 & The goblins ate a man and carried the horses away. \\
  8 & No, just one horse; they ate the other on the spot. \\
  9 & There are rotting mushrooms on the ground. \\
  10 & These rotting mushrooms are not from around here. \\
  11 & The goblins carried the boulders up trees. \\
  12 & Someone carried something heavy, away from the goblins.%

These are \glspl{glowshroom}, which can glow in the dark when agitated.%

\paragraph{Soon after}
\gls{susjot} arrives to ensure the \glspl{pc} clear up the wreckage.

\begin{boxtext}[What do you say?]
  Hooves and wheels smash through the
  \ifnum\value{temperature}=0%
    frost
  \else%
    mud
  \fi.
  Behind, six \glspl{guard}, all in black, struggle to keep up.
  The wagon stops as his horse pulls back from the sight of the wreckage.
  He jumps off with a writing tablet under his arms, an angry scowl, and a wagon behind him.
  \begin{speechtext}
      Are you the new \glspl{fodder}?
      Welcome to the \gls{templeOfBeasts}!
      Did you restock the logs for the \gls{bothy}?
  \end{speechtext}
\end{boxtext}

\iftoggle{intro}{
  Some of the \glspl{guard} running behind are \glspl{soldier}.
  Others are new \glspl{fodder} --- and additional characters for the players.
  Tell the players that they can take another character by spending \pgls{storypoint}, and explaining how they know this person.%
  \footnote{Spending \pgls{storypoint} also earns 5~\glspl{xp}, but feel free to ignore this if running a oneshot.}

  \begin{boxtext}[]
    \Gls{susjot} explains the duties in the \gls{templeOfBeasts}:

      \begin{speechtext}
        I understand people find the first day scary, but not as scary as the first \gls{monster}, eh?

        Don't look so morose.
        You look like someone took your \gls{dawnDolly}!

        And you don't `have to kill \glspl{monster}', you \underline{get to kill \glspl{monster}}.
        (But also you have to kill \glspl{monster} or it's back to the \gls{court})

        But first, you can clear the road\ldots
        Poor, old \composeHumanName\ and \composeHumanName.
        You can stick the bodies in my cart back there.
        I'll tell the families they died heroes.
      \end{speechtext}
  \end{boxtext}

}{
  This make a good juncture for players to spend \pgls{storypoint} to introduce an ally%
  \exRef{stories}{Stories}{oldFriend}
  from the \glspl{fodder}, because players should have two characters upon entering the mine.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Pgls{susjot} explains a `goblin raid' has taken place, and they (the \glspl{pc}, not him) need to clear the road.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} ask about the raid,}
\gls{susjot} has heard about it only yesterday, and immediately sent some \glspl{gDigger} out to kill the goblins, and retrieve the chest of gold they took.

\segment[\gls{afternoon}]{bothy}% AREA
{What the \Glsfmttext{notary} Saw}% NAME
{``Two night guards ran away with that chest of gold''}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}[Who's taking the tinder box?]
  A lightly-armoured wagon rolls down the road (hardened leather surrounds the driver).
  A wide-brimmed hat pops out the side, with sad eyes underneath.
  She looks to the forest with a little fear, then hails \pgls{susjot}.

  \begin{speechtext}
    I just saw your men!
    They had the chest of gold alright.
    But they were heading down the mountain, not here.
  \end{speechtext}

  \Pgls{susjot} asks ``\textit{How many?}''.

  \Pgls{woetide} replies ``\textit{Maybe two.  I didn't get a good look}''.

  That moment, \gls{susjot} asks the \glspl{soldier} to chase after the \glspl{guard} with the chest, and then turns to you.

  \Gls{susjot} looks enraged, and orders the \glspl{soldier} to hunt down the `deserters', and bring back the chest.
  Then he turns to you.

  \begin{speechtext}
    Good news; you haven an easy job.
    Go up to the old mine, on the mountain up there, kill the goblins, and take any remaining \gls{coin} they might have.
    It's just like stealing from an ugly baby, okay?

    Anyone who returns with a goblin head gets promoted to \gls{gDigger} and \pgls{sp}.
    If nobody returns with one, it's back to the \gls{court} with the lot of you.
  \end{speechtext}

  \Gls{susjot} orders the \glspl{soldier} to fetch \pgls{torch} for everyone.

\paragraph{\Pgls{woetide} moves on soon after,}
but the \glspl{pc} can ask her some questions before she becomes too upset, and moves on.
Insensitive questions mean she moves on immediately.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  She's \pgls{notary} from the \gls{templeOfFrost}, who recorded \pgls{village} who wanted to deposit their communal savings --- a chest of 100~\glspl{gp}.

  \textit{\textbf{False}: the \gls{village} desposited 1,000~\glspl{sp} with \pgls{weight} of 10.}
  \item
  Green-glowing goblins arrived, and killed everyone.

  \textit{\textbf{Half-True}: goblins are mostly the colour of bone.
  But when they eat \glspl{glowshroom}, their stomachs glow green.}
  \item
  The goblins stole the chest, and left.

  \textit{\textbf{False}: goblins have no use for \glspl{coin}.}
  \item
  She barely survived by running up the road to a nearby \pgls{village}.

  \textit{\textbf{False}: she ran to Stoatfen~\Gls{bothy} to hide, then hid the chest once the goblins left.}
