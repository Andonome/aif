Run these three \glspl{segment} in rapid succession.
They establish the links between the goblin-infested mine and the outside world.

\segment[\gls{afternoon}]{bothy}% AREA
{What the \Glsfmttext{notary} Saw}% NAME
{``Two night guards ran away with that chest of gold''}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}[]
  A lightly-armoured wagon rolls down the road (hardened leather surrounds the driver).
  A wide-brimmed hat pops out the side, with sad eyes underneath.
  She looks to the forest with a little fear, then hails \pgls{susjot}.

  \begin{speechtext}
    I just saw your men!
    They had the chest of gold alright.
    But they were heading down the mountain, not here.
  \end{speechtext}

  \Pgls{susjot} asks ``\textif{How many?}''.

  \Pgls{woetide} replies ``\textif{Maybe two.  I didn't get a good look}''.

  That moment, \gls{susjot} asks the \glspl{soldier} to chase after the \glspl{guard} with the chest, and then turns to you.

\end{boxtext}

\segment[\gls{morning}]{Mountain}% AREA
{The Innocent Man in the Shadows}% NAME
{\Glsfmttext{fodder} \scaredFodder\ fled from the goblin caves, and wants to know if he can return}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  Last week, \scaredFodder\ entered the \gls{guard} after smuggling swords into a town for a friend, so they didn't have to pay tax (or explain the \glspl{weapon}).
  Four days ago, \pgls{susjot} ordered him and all the new \glspl{fodder} to enter an abandoned mine, kill the goblins, and return with the treasure the goblins stole from \gls{woetide} and the rest of that caravan.

  The goblins killed most of the new \glspl{guard}.
  Only \scaredFodder\ made it out alive.
\end{exampletext}

\scaredFodder\ knows he should have returned with goblin heads, and doesn't want to report mission failure.
He waits near the \gls{bothy}, in the shadows of the forest, for the right moment to talk with someone who might be sympathetic.

\begin{boxtext}
  Snapping twigs.
  Gentle footsteps approach.

  {grimaced-smile}% MANNERISM
  {to tell everyone he's not a criminal}]% WANTS

\begin{boxtext}
  A sunburnt man steps into a ray of Sunlight, mostly bald and half-grey on what remains, wearing a black cassock just like yours.

  \begin{speechtext}
    Hi.
    My name is \scaredFodder.
    \Gls{fodder}~\scaredFodder.

    \ldots

    \Pgls{susjot} sent the five of us into the old mine, to kill the goblins and return with the treasure they stole.
    But we didn't get the treasure.
    We died.
    Then I ran away.
    A trader told me they're looking for me.
    She said I should run away.
    Can you check if it's safe for me to come back?
  \end{speechtext}

  The sunburnt man pulls a smiling grimace, as if forcing himself to stay hopeful.
\end{boxtext}

The `trader' who told \scaredFodder\ that he's a wanted fugitive is \gls{woetide}.
\scaredFodder\ does not know anything about her, but can describe her big eye-bags.

\paragraph{If anyone asks about the details at the mines,}
\scaredFodder\ explains a little, but won't give more details until someone reassures him that nobody thinks he's guilty.

\begin{speechtext}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    The entrance is easy.
    It's a hole in the ground, so bring something to get down with -- a rope, a stake, and a mallet.
    \item
    The goblins won't fight, they just run away.
    \item
    The darkness in caves isn't like the darkness at night.
    At night, the sky is dark, but in a cave, the darkness stands right next to you.
    \item
    The ground is rough -- you can't run anywhere.
    That means the goblins can stand back and throw things at you.
    \item
    And if you carry \pgls{torch}, they can see you, but you can't see them.
    And when you put it out, they can hear you, and you still get hit by rocks.
    \item
    I swear I heard \gls{yonder}'s bell down there, calling everyone downwards into the dark.
  \end{itemize}
\end{speechtext}

\act{reassure \scaredFodder}{Charisma}{Empathy}{10}
If that succeeds, he offers more details.

\begin{speechtext}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \composeHumanName\ died falling through a rotten bridge that the miner's left.
    Look out for a hole in the ground, and tread carefully around it, one at a time.
    
    \hint{\autopageref{firstBridge}, area \ref{firstBridge}}
    \item
    The goblins left a rope for us to get down.
    We thought it was a trap, but it's not.
    
    \hint{\autopageref{ropeDown}, area \ref{ropeDown}}
    \item
    We went down a tunnel with a dead goblin, then Tukala died.
    He was my little gnome-buddy, and he just lay down and died.
    I didn't see anything happen to him, he just died.
    \iftoggle{intro}{}{He never finished teaching me how to play \gls{shellGame}.}
    
    \hint{\autopageref{standingTunnel}, area \ref{standingTunnel}}
    \item
    The next bit, we had to crawl under a narrow pass.
    They were waiting for us at the other side, throwing rocks and javelins as we came up.
    That's when I ran back up.
    
    \hint{\autopageref{hungryHall}, area \ref{hungryHall}}
    \item
    I waited a while, but nobody else came back up.
    Five of us went in.
    All four, dead.
    \item
    I'm never going back there again!
  \end{itemize}
\end{speechtext}

\segment[\gls{afternoon}]{Mountain}% AREA
{Gold in the Mines}% NAME
{The \glsfmttext{jotter} demands the troupe go to the mines and kill the goblins}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  Two days ago, \gls{woetide} informed \gls{susjot} that she saw three \glspl{guard} coming from the old mine, carrying a heavy chest.
  \Gls{susjot} has figured those \glspl{guard} took the chest of \glsentrylongpl{gp} and decided to flee, and live beyond the \gls{edge} (effectively making them bandits).
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}[What do you say?]
  Hooves and wheels smash through the
  \ifnum\value{temperature}=0%
    frost
  \else%
    mud
  \fi.
  Behind, six \glspl{guard}, all in black, struggle to keep up.
  The coachman arrives with a writing tablet under his arms and an angry scowl.
  \begin{speechtext}
      Are you the new \glspl{fodder}?
      Welcome to the \gls{templeOfBeasts}!
      Did you restock the logs for the \gls{bothy}?
  \end{speechtext}
\end{boxtext}

\iftoggle{intro}{
  Some of the \glspl{guard} running behind are new \glspl{fodder}, and additional characters for the players.
  Hand them out, and do another round of introductions.

  This also makes a good opportunity to let \gls{susjot} fill in some more details on the \gls{templeOfBeasts}.

  \begin{boxtext}[]
    \begin{speechtext}
      I understand people find the first day scary, but not as scary as the first \gls{monster}, eh?

      Don't look so morose.
      You look like someone took your \gls{dawnDolly}!

      And you don't `have to kill \glspl{monster}', you \underline{get to kill \glspl{monster}}.
      (But also you have to kill \glspl{monster} or it's back to the \gls{court})
    \end{speechtext}
  \end{boxtext}

}{
  This make a good juncture for players to spend \pgls{storypoint} to introduce an ally, because players should have two characters upon entering the mine.
}

Once \gls{susjot} feels satisfied with the state of Stoatfen~\Gls{bothy}, he gives the troupe their mission.

\begin{boxtext}[Do you speak, or leave immediately?]
  \Gls{susjot} tells you:

  \begin{speechtext}
    It's time to go up the mine, and kill some goblins!

    Listen, it's an easy job.
    Just go and kill the goblins, and take any remaining \gls{coin} they might have.
    It's just like stealing from an ugly baby, okay?

    You may keep one \glsentrylong{sp} for each goblin head you return with.

    The last lot of \glspl{fodder} who went up just left with the gold, and didn't even kill the goblins.
    So now it's no more mister nice-\gls{jotter}.
    Now anyone who comes back without a goblin head gets sent back to the \gls{court} for a good neck-stretch, okay?
  \end{speechtext}
\end{boxtext}

\iftoggle{intro}{%
  Everyone uses the same \gls{natural}.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} ask about the missing \glspl{fodder},}
\gls{susjot} questions them about what they know, and mentions that \pgls{notary} has witnessed three of the \glspl{guard} making off with a `heavy chest', near the entrance to the mines.%
\footnote{This claim is false.
See \vpageref{goldConspiracy}.}

\Gls{soldier}~\composeHumanName\ happily mentions the reward for bringing in the deserters: 5~\glspl{gp} dead, 20~\glspl{gp} alive.
