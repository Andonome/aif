\subsection{Getting There}

The opening to the old mine is 5 miles away, which the troupe can walk in \pgls{interval}.
However, if they don't walk extra-fast (and gain \pgls{ep}) then they will have to hunt for the cave-mouth by twilight.
But either way, a goblin scout will notice them walking in the open, and call for more goblins to wait in ambush.


\act[In daylight \glspl{pc}]{find the entrance}{Wits}{Caving}{6}
In the early evening's twilight, the \gls{tn} is 8, and at night rises to~10.
\iftoggle{intro}{%
  If the troupe split up, they can use \pgls{bandAct}.
  Either way, an extra roll requires an extra \gls{interval}.
}{}

\begin{boxtext}
  Ascending up the \ifnum\value{temperature}=0 snowy \fi slope, the \showTemperature\ breeze clears lumps of low-lying cloud, leaving the face barren except for patches of pine trees.
  It will be dark soon.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{If the troupe camp overnight,}
the goblins come, one every hour, to throw a javelin or rock at them.%
\footnote{All goblin statblocks appear \vpageref{goblinBlocks}.}
They stand well back from the camp, and suffer a -4~Penalty to the throw, but the point is not to kill the \glspl{pc}; the point is to stop them sleeping.

\ifnum\value{temperature}<2%
  Of course, they will need a fire to stay warm, so staying out of sight is not an option.

\subsection{The Mouth}

The cave-mouth is a muddy hole, with a wicked slope.
The drop to the ground is 4~\glspl{step} directly down, and not easy to climb up.%
\footnote{The goblins emerge by sending one with claws to climb, and then helping the others with a rope.}

\act{enter without falling over}{Dexterity}{Caving}{6}
Entering the cave and staying on one's feet requires a \roll{Dexterity}{Caving} roll at \tn[6].
Failure means the \gls{pc} lands prone%
\exRef{core}{Core Rules}{prone}
and receives 2~Damage plus their Strength~\gls{attribute},

\label{goblinCaveEntrance}

\begin{boxtext}[Where do you go?]
  You stand in a shaft of Sunlight.
  Darkness surrounds.
  The sound of your landing echoes back to you.
  High-pitched, mocking, giggling noises follow it.
  Then come the rocks.
\end{boxtext}

\act{avoid the goblin rocks}{Speed}{Vigilance}{\roll{Dexterity}{Projectiles}}
\iftoggle{intro}{%
  A successful roll means the \gls{pc} can dodge the rocks by \gls{running}.
  A failed roll means Damage, and a tie means the player dodges by ducking, but does not move anywhere.
}{}

\iftoggle{intro}{
  Keep  careful track of the \glspl{ap}, for both goblins and \glspl{pc} --- each time \pgls{pc} decides where to run or whether or not to enter the hole, they spend a little more time, until the \gls{round} resets.
}{}

\playCommentaryDust[t]

\subsubsection{Screams Above}

Once most of the \glspl{pc} enter the dark hole, two skinny goblins crawl out of a tiny side-tunnel, and cause trouble at the top.
The tunnel is only big enough for those with Strength~-1 or lower.
Anything larger than this cannot fit through the narrow tunnel.

}

\subsection{The Cave-In}
\label{caveIn}

The second after two characters get down the hole, the goblins flee, and the \glspl{pc} will almost certainly follow.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} decide to wait,}
the goblins simply don't return.

\begin{boxtext}
  The flickering torch illuminates a soaking wet cave, littered with bone-dry rocks of every size.
  The air is thick with rocky dust.
\end{boxtext}

The dry rocks on the ground have fallen from the ceiling recently.
The shouting and \ifnum\value{temperature}=1 recent flooding \else stomping \fi in the cavern have begun a cave-in.

\subsubsection{The Cavern Collapses}
once the troupe follow the goblins down.
Fleeing to safety requires a \roll{Speed}{Athletics} roll at \tn[3] for the first \gls{pc} who descended.
Every \gls{pc} after that has +1 to the \gls{tn} (so the fifth \gls{pc} rolls at \tn[7]).
Failure means the rocks fall on them, inflicting $2D6$~Damage, and they roll again with +1 to the~\gls{tn}.

\paragraph{If any \glspl{pc} flees back to the entrance,}
the \gls{tn} is 17 for the first \gls{pc} who descended, with -1 to the \gls{tn} for subsequent \glspl{pc} (so the fifth rolls at \tn[13]).

Once out, they find themselves alone on the \showTemperature\ mountain slope.
Alone except for the two goblins who sneaked out earlier.
The goblins hear the cave-in, and flee homeward.

\label{pcRunaways}
You can leave these \glspl{pc} as wildcards, until the end of the session, then try to fill in their day with a couple of rolls, just as the troupe begin to exit the mountain, far below (assuming anyone survives).

will be able to chase them to `the \nameref{sunRoof}' (\vpageref{sunRoof}).

\paragraph{Once the cavern collapses,}
the dust thrown up inflicts \pgls{ep} each \gls{round}, until the \glspl{pc} leave the \gls{area}.

\act{squeeze out the narrow exit passage, \glspl{pc} must}{Dexterity}{Caving}{\roll{Strength}{6}}
Once \pgls{pc} gets out, they can help the others in \pgls{bandAct} (but the \gls{natural} remains).
