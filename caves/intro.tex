\chapter{Setting the Table}

\subsection*{Setup}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Skip the complete \textit{Core Rules} book for now.
  All the rules you'll need are in the glossary \vpageref{glosPreamble}.
  \item
  Skip the glossary.
  It appears at the start so you can skim it, and come back when you want something from it.
  \item
  Read the examples of play.
  \item
  Rip the character sheets from the back -- each player can have a couple.
  \item
  Grab the goblin blocks \vpageref{goblinBlocks}, so you can track how many remain alive, and keep the \glsfmtplural{statblock} to hand at all time.
  Each time the troupe encounter a group of goblins, they should encounter half of the total goblins.
  \item
  Slice out the miniature rulebook at the end, then fold, bind with floss, and slice the leaves open.
  It's not required, but it is fun.
\end{itemize}
