\subsection*{The False Premises}

The story opens with three lies; goblins robbed a caravan of its gold, three \glspl{guard} went to kill them but flet with the gold instead, and now the troupe have an easy mission: enter a hole in the mountains, and kill the goblins.

Once inside, they find the goblins do not play fair.
The fight with smoke, darkness, and stones.

\subsection*{Setup}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Slice out the miniature rulebook at the end, then fold, bind with floss, and slice the leaves open.
  It's not required, but it is fun.
  \item
  Slice the character sheets from the back.
  \item
  Skim the glossary, just enough to know where to find entries later.
  \item
  Have a practice-run through the module with a few characters, reading the box-text and making one quick decision or roll, then move on to the next \gls{area}.
\end{itemize}
