\section{Descent into the Darkness}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\mapentry[start]{Fresh Hall}

Ask each of the \glspl{pc} to describe what their characters are doing.
If none of them mention holding a light, then none of their characters have a light source.

\begin{boxtext}
  None of the characters were holding a light.
  Where did you leave the torch?
  It must have dropped before the last tunnel.
\end{boxtext}

\noindent
The troupe will almost certainly want to stop and rest here for \pgls{interval}.
Once a light has been organized, the troupe can look around and take a rest.

\begin{boxtext}
  This fresh hall has an ambient drip of water, and moisture everywhere.
  The ceiling slopes down gently, surrounding the entire passage with a ring of low-hanging darkness.
  Large, damp, rocks litter the ground in every direction.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{The way out}
goes down, sharply.

The troupe should roll \roll{Dexterity}{Caving} (\tn[10]).
A tie means the first person can drop an item instead of taking the fall.
Falling down the passage inflicts $1D6-1$ Damage (a helmet provides a maximum of \gls{dr} 1, no other armour counts).

\begin{boxtext}
  Ahead, the tunnel stops sloping, and continues, flat.
  A wide shadow indicates a hole in the ground.
\end{boxtext}

\mapentry[firstBridge]{First Bridge}

\begin{exampletext}
  The human prospectors (who looked for a good place to mine) built two bridges.
  Over time, dust, rocks, and other debris covered the bridge entirely.
  Then the wood degraded, leaving a natural trap.

  The first group of \glspl{guard} to descend ran across the bridge, so half of it crumbled, sending them falling to the pit of sharp rocks below.
  One died, and his body, and equipment, were left down here to rot.
\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{If the troupe inspect the hole,}
they will see the ground here is degraded wood.

\paragraph{If the troupe go across the wood,}
anyone with a \gls{weight} of 9 or more (including equipment) will make the remains of the bridge collapse.

\paragraph{Jumping over the bridge,}
requires a \roll{Speed}{Athletics} roll (\tn[9]).
A tie means the bridge collapses, but the character has crossed safely.

\paragraph{Falling into the hole}
inflicts $1D6+2$ Damage.

\paragraph{Entering the hole}
requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Caving} roll (\tn[10]), to understand a safe route down.

The players can make this a group roll, by having their characters discuss the safest route down, if they are prepared to spend \pgls{interval} on the discussion.
