\mapentry[start]{Fresh Hall}

The troupe will almost certainly want to stop and rest here for \pgls{interval}.
The air smells dusty, but fresh enough to rest.

\begin{boxtext}
  This fresh hall has an ambient drip of water, and moisture everywhere.
  The ceiling slopes down gently, surrounding the entire passage with a ring of low-hanging darkness.
  Large, damp, rocks litter the ground in every direction.

\mapentry[falseExit]{False Exit}

The path travels upwards until opening on the mountain's side.
Unfortunately, the path also exits onto the side of a cliff, so the troupe cannot simply walk down.

Climbing down requires a \roll{Dexterity}{Athletics} at \tn[14].%
\footnote{If a player insists on attempting this check, you should roll for them, and tell them if they succeed or fail.  The other players will only find out if their characters can climb down later -- they should not know their chances of success by looking at the \gls{natural}.}
Failure means death.

\mapentry[firstBridge]{First Bridge}

\begin{exampletext}
  The human miners built two bridges while exploring further into the mountain.
  Over time, dust, rocks, and other debris covered this first bridge entirely.
  Then the wood degraded, leaving a natural trap.

  When first group of \glspl{guard} came through here, the bridge collapsed, sending one down to a pit of sharp rocks below.
  He died instantly, and the group moved on.
\end{exampletext}

If the troupe walk with a light, they instantly see the hole in the ground (but their torch is probably about to go out at this point).
Otherwise, they should roll \roll{Wits}{Caving} at \tn[8].

\paragraph{If the troupe go across the wood,}
anyone with \pgls{weight} of 13 or more (including their \gls{equipment}) will make the remains of the bridge collapse.

\paragraph{Jumping over the bridge,}
requires a \roll{Speed}{Athletics} roll (\tn[9]).
A tie means the bridge collapses, but the character has crossed safely.

Anyone falling into the hole receives $1D6$ Damage plus their own Strength Bonus (bigger creatures suffer more from falling).

The corpse is dry, and not very rotten.
His satchel still contains two bees-wax candles which can burn for an hour each, a tinder-box, \lootMedium, and slightly-expired \rations.

Entering the hole requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Caving} roll (\tn[7]) to understand a safe route down.
Once \pgls{pc} explains the hand-holds and where to place the legs, anyone can descend safely.
Failure means falling, and $1D6$~Damage plus the \gls{pc} Strength \gls{attribute}.

\mapentry[ropeDown]{Rope \& Cliff}

\begin{exampletext}
  This cavern has a tall cliff-face, ten \glspl{step} straight down, so the goblins descend with a rope tied to a boulder.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}
  The cavern seems to end in a wall, but the shadows at the bottom indicate a dark drop.
  A boulder stands next to the drop with a rope tied around it.
  The rope droops down towards whatever waits at the bottom.
\end{boxtext}

This may look like a trap, but it isn't; the goblins simply use the rope to climb up and down.
The boulder can take up to \pgls{weight} of 11 before it falls, and the rope can take up to \pgls{weight} of 14 before it snaps (this includes items, as usual).

\wayOut{The wide cavern leads to}{secondBridge}

}

\mapentry[secondBridge]{Last Bridge}

\begin{exampletext}
  The second old mining bridge has degraded almost as much as the first, so the goblins walk across carefully, and one at a time.
\end{exampletext}

Anyone stepping on the bridge with a total \gls{weight} of 10 or more will break it.

\paragraph{Falling into the river's frigid water}

\wayOut{The slender crack leads immediately to}{wormTunnel}

\begin{boxtext}
  Once off the bridge, the smell of goblin-shit haunts your noses.
  It covers the ground, and drips off the tall pile of stones to the side, then stops suddenly; the passage beyond seems clear.

  Leaning on the wall, you discover a gap in the wall the size of a window.
\end{boxtext}

\mapentry[standingTunnel]{Standing Tunnel}

\begin{exampletext}
  The human miners stopped at this point when their budgies died.%
  \footnote{Miners use small, sensitive, birds to detect lethal gas.  If the bird dies, it's time to leave.}

  The next time they returned, they came back with a little wooden box, with the budgie's name -- `Happy' -- carved onto the top, and placed it under a little cairn.

  When the goblins moved in, they did not understand the significance of the little cairn, so one died in the passage.
  Since then, they use the tunnel only as a toilet.
\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{Carbon monoxide}
lays in the low parts of the tunnel, around waist-height to a human.
It won't do any harm to walking humans, but if a gnome or dwarf enter, they will start to feel sleepy, then die.
The same goes for anyone sitting down to rest.

The first sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is usually death, but in this case the first sign is a dead goblin (10~\glspl{step} down the passage).
It died weeks ago, but has no marks -- no cuts or bruises -- and the corpse has not decayed much, due to the infertile conditions in the cave.

The second warning sign is a dead gnome (20~\glspl{step} down the passage).
He has no items, as his companions picked up his bag before moving on.

\paragraph{If the players fail to heed the warning signs,}
\glspl{pc} familiar with caves might get a strange feeling.
The troupe can roll \roll{Intelligence}{Caving} (\tn[13]) to at least get the impression that they should not linger.

\paragraph{Failure}
means gnomes, dwarves, and anyone who rests will accrue invisible \glspl{ep} -- you should note the \glspl{ep} without telling them, just apply any Penalty secretly by adding it to every \gls{tn}.
Soon after the \glsentrylongpl{ep} begin, the character dies, suddenly, and quietly.
Then anyone kneeling down to inspect them dies too.

\paragraph{After a mile,}
the passage ascends.
Various twists mean it continues longer than its neighbouring tunnel, making it 2 miles long.

\playCommentaryPuddle[t]

\mapentry[wormTunnel]{Worm Tunnel}

The goblins cannot traverse the \nameref{standingTunnel}, so they must crawl through this passage.
The \glspl{pc} will probably have a difficult time here, and the goblins know it.
The narrow tunnel extends a full mile before the troupe can stretch their arms again, and it counts as two miles due to the cramped conditions.

\paragraph{To squeeze through,}
each player rolls \roll{Dexterity}{Caving}.
The \gls{tn} equals 5 plus the character's Strength and \gls{dr}; so characters with Strength~-1 roll at \tn[4], while those with Strength~+2 and armour with \gls{dr}~3 roll at \tn[10].

On a tie, characters gain 2~\glspl{ep} from the shuffling and scrapes.
One a failure, they also become stuck, and others will have to take time to help.

  \ref{waterMaze}/05/18,
}

\paragraph{Resting}
requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Caving} roll (\tn[8]).
Failure means the character does not manage to remove \pgls{ep} after the rest.

\begin{boxtext}
  Everyone at the back finds the sharp rocks stop them resting, and they have to move.
  Those in the middle try to clear the fist-sized rocks, but more keep falling down from little crevices all around, so you try further down the tunnel, but then everyone at the front contracts a headache from lying with their legs above their heads on a downward slope.
  The group repacks half-eaten \glspl{ration} and moves further into the tunnel, but the next stretch is somehow worse.
  Over an hour has passed, and nobody has managed to rest.
\end{boxtext}

The \gls{natural} may let some rest, but not others.
In this case, the troupe can push on (without wasting \pgls{interval}), or remain, and let some rest while the rest fail to find a comfy spot.

\paragraph{Once they near the exit,}
they must shuffle out slowly, with their head poking out.
At this point, a goblin lying in wait attacks with an automatic \gls{vitalShot}.
\ifnum\value{temperature}=3%
  The only clue about the danger, is the gentle sound of the nearby river.
\fi%
Hearing a motionless goblin is extremely unlikely, but you might ask for a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll at \tn[16] from the character in the lead, if they have any chance of succeeding at the roll.

\playCommentaryDrowning[t]

%\Needspace{7\baselineskip}
\mapentry[gentlePassage]{Soft Passage}

This path, like the entrance, has had a little cave-in, and will have more if anyone large walks through it.
The players may spot the danger, or you can give the characters a roll for \gls{gagingCave}.

\begin{boxtext}
  The path widens, and you can comfortably walk, without ducking.
  The wet cavern walls stand apart, allowing everyone to walk together, with two or three side-by-side.
  You step carefully over the little dry stones which cover the floor.
\end{boxtext}

Just like the entrance cave-in (\vpageref{caveIn}), the ceiling is ready to fall.

\paragraph{If they spot the danger}
(by noticing the dry rocks) and walk carefully, the troupe rolls \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth} at \tn[7].

\paragraph{If nobody notices the danger}
characters can roll \roll{Wits}{Caving} at \tn[10].
Failure means the roof starts collapsing, and each player rolls \roll{Speed}{Athletics} (\tn[3] for the first, then 4, 5,\ldots).

\wayOut{If the troupe return before the cave-in, they can go back to}{firstBridge}

\wayOut{The passage soon becomes more stable, and half a mile later, emerges at}{cliffDive}

\mapentry[cliffDive]{Cliff Dive}

This passage ends abruptly with a cliff, overlooking an underground lake.
The only way down is a rocky climb, and the water below is 5 degrees.
Luckily, the lake is deep, and nobody will hit the ground.

\begin{boxtext}
  The cave widens, then halts at a cliff, the height of two men.
  \ifnum\value{temperature}>1%
    The darkness below looks perfectly smooth -- a flat, black, surface.
  \else%
    The black waters below show very little movement, but the echoes of running water suggest a strong undercurrent.
  \fi%
\end{boxtext}

The \glspl{pc} will have a difficult decision, since they can't tell if the dive will kill them.

\paragraph{Climbing or diving down}
demands a \roll{Dexterity}{Athletics} roll at \tn[8].%
\footnote{Planning cannot help with this roll -- the characters cannot see below well enough to plan.}
Failure inflicts $1D3$ Damage as they crash against jagged rocks on the cliff-face or a wall.

\paragraph{Once in the water,}
\ifnum\value{temperature}>1%
  the \glspl{pc} begin to feel a slow current.
  They can swim upstream, or downstream.
\else%
  \set{track}{5}%
  \ifnum\value{temperature}=3%
    \addtocounter{track}{2}%
  \fi%
  the river's current pushes the \glspl{pc} downstream unless they resist with \roll{Speed}{Athletics} (\gls{tn}~\arabic{track}).
\fi%

\wayOut{Swimming upstream leads to}{secondBridge}

\wayOut{The currents carry characters gently to the riverbank, by}{waterMaze}

\wayOut{Characters who continue down-river eventually reach}{lakeStop}

\mapentry[lakeStop]{Bone Scraper}

\Glspl{pc} who remain in the water float gently towards a deadly drop.
They can feel what's coming with a \roll{Wits}{Caving} at \tn[7] (or \tn[10] in the dark, which they probably will be, if floating down river).

\paragraph{On a tie,}
the character falls a short way onto a large rock.
Climbing back requires a \roll{Speed}{Athletics} roll (\tn[10]).

\wayOut{Falling inflicts $\dmg{14}$~Damage, plus the character's Strength \gls{attribute}, then on to}{blindFish}

\wayOut{Turning back can only lead towards}{waterMaze}

\playCommentaryTeamwork[t]

\mapentry[waterMaze]{Drowned Pass}

\begin{exampletext}
  This passage was once a normal, downward incline, to a series of small tunnels, one of which leads out to the `\nameref{hungryHall}'.
  Since then, a minor earthquake has changed the ground just enough to let the river drip into the tunnel, leaving it completely underwater.
\end{exampletext}

Imagine getting from your front door to your cooker in complete darkness.
Now imagine doing that in a stranger's house.
Now imagine the house is under water.
The simple presence of water will make this a harrowing task for the \glspl{pc}.

The players will have to map the passage, in one way or another.

Whoever enters the frigid waters instantly gains \pgls{ep}, and the exertion of swimming (as usual) inflicts another.

Remember to ask about the backpacks every time a character enters.
Their \glspl{ration} almost certainly do not have waterproof coverings, nor do their tinder boxes.
The \glspl{torch}, however, still light fine, even while soaking.

\paragraph{Once out of the water and rested,}
the character can remove all \glspl{ep} from holding their breath in the water, but not the \gls{ep} gained for swimming\ifnum\value{temperature}=2\else, or the \glspl{ep} for entering freezing waters\fi.

\mapentry[hungryHall]{Hungry Hall}

\begin{exampletext}
  This chamber could fit an entire \glsentrytext{village} inside it, and has plenty of fresh air, but not unlimited air.
  The goblins understand the cavern's limits well, so they lit a fire, and cooked the body of \pgls{guard} who died here days ago, then left.
\end{exampletext}

The goblins' fire still burns, and the air will become unbreathable within \pgls{interval}, inflicting \gls{hypoxia} on anyone in the cavern.

\begin{boxtext}
  Emerging from the water, you see a fire burning in the distance.
  Despite the bright flames, you cannot see the ceiling or walls of the cavern.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{Standing by the \gls{caveFire}}
will help \glspl{pc} dry off after the dunk from the \nameref{waterMaze}.

Inside the fire sits the charred bones of \pgls{guard}.
His armour lies nearby, with teeth-marks.
His coins lie discarded by the fire -- \lootSmall\ in total.%
\footnote{The coins are a clue.  They demonstrate that the goblins do not care about coins, so they did not take the money that \gls{susjot} thinks they did.}

\setcounter{diceNo}{0}%

\paragraph{Finding the exits}
requires a \roll{Speed}{Caving} roll at \tn[9] (or \tn[14] if they put out the fire).
The troupe can only use \pgls{bandAct} if they split up.

They can also make this \pgls{restingaction} if they are prepared to spend \pgls{interval} doing it carefully.

These tunnels have enough good air in them to prevent \gls{hypoxia} getting any worse, but not enough to cure whatever effects have begun.

\wayOut{One passage out smells like farts, and leads to}{gas}

\wayOut{Another, smaller, tunnel leads down to}{darkTunnel}

\mapentry[gas]{Fire Cavern}

The passage here leads upwards for half a mile, to a chamber where flammable gas seeps in through little air-vents.

The party can make a \roll{Wits}{Caving} roll (\tn[12]) to notice the smell before their torches ignite it, dealing $2D6$ Damage to the first half of the characters, and $1D6$ to the second half.
\Glspl{pc} with armour can reduce the Damage by an amount equal to its \gls{covering} (so minus 3 in most cases).

\wayOut{After the \nameref{gas}, the tunnel descends to}{smokePassage}

\mapentry[smokePassage]{Smokey Passage}

The goblins wait at the bottom of this long passageway, to light a fire with all their \fireFuel, once the troupe descend.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} have been creeping quietly,}
call for \pgls{resistedaction}: \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth}, against the goblins' \roll{Wits}{Vigilance}.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} rush,}
they can roll \roll{Speed}{Caving} (\tn[10]) to hold their breath.
Every Failure Margin inflicts \pgls{ep}, and the same \gls{natural} counts for everyone.

Whether the \glspl{pc} rush up or down makes no difference.
The goblins leave after setting the fire, and the smoke clears within \pgls{interval}.

\wayOut{This alcove sits at the side of}{blindFish}

\mapentry[darkTunnel]{Dark Tunnel}

The goblins abandoned this narrow, meandering maze when \pgls{hulk} blocked the exit, but their footprints (and claw-prints) remain in places, hinting at the correct route out.

Finding that exit needs an \roll{Intelligence}{Caving} roll at \tn[10].
Each failure adds a pointless mile to the journey, but decreases the \gls{tn} by~1 for the next roll.%
%\footnote{The players don't need to stick with the same \gls{natural}, because each time, the situation and location has changed.}

\begin{boxtext}
  A tunnel cuts across the current one, letting you divert left or right.

  Ahead, the torchlight barely illuminates another branching cavern ahead.
  How will you find the right way out, with so many paths in the cave?
\end{boxtext}

Each reasonable answer the \glspl{pc} give should reduce the \gls{tn} by 1 or~2.

\paragraph{If the troupe have \pgls{torch} lit,}
the oxygen in the tunnels will deplete, causing \gls{hypoxia}.
This will leave the party with a real problem -- tiredness, and hallucinations can follow.

If the troupe avoid lighting any torch in the narrow tunnel, they will have to try \gls{blackWalking}.%
%\footnote{This \glsentrydesc{blackWalking}.}

\begin{boxtext}
  You stop for a small breather, and smell the stuffy air, then notice little goblinoid silhouettes up ahead or behind.
\end{boxtext}

That little verbal slip-up -- `ahead or behind' -- should be given with intention.
The troupe will have trouble remembering which direction they came from and which they were going to.
If they ask about the odd phrasing, tell them what they're having trouble remembering; otherwise, simply wait until the troupe have dealt with the imaginary goblins, and decide to continue moving.

The goblins there will irritate the \gls{hulk}, causing it to chase the goblins, who flee across the river in the \stateArea{blindFish}.

\mapentry[blindFish]{Blind Fish Rapids}

A long, lazy, river with a wicked undercurrent cuts across this cavern.
The \glspl{pc} will need to vault it or swim across.
Once on the other side, they can use the wooden planks goblins have left on the other side to get across.

One wooden plank is stable, the other has a cut across the middle.
Using the planks without examining them results in \pgls{pc} falling through the water.

\begin{boxtext}
  A wide crack in the ground ahead falls away to reveal a river, almost within touching distance.
  It moves silently, and looks the colour of black tea under the torchlight.
\end{boxtext}

\paragraph{Swimming}
demands a \roll{Strength}{Seafaring} roll (\tn[10]).
Rolling a tie means the character can make no progress -- they simply fight against the river's undercurrent, gain \pgls{ep}, and roll again.

Rolling a failure means the river pulls the character downriver, the \gls{tn} increases by +2, and the character gains \pgls{ep} then rolls again.

\paragraph{Examining the river}
reveals little fish, about the size of a finger.

Any reasonable plan to catch them might work, although placing \pgls{caveFire} safely can prove very difficult.

\mapentry[goblinHole]{Goblin Hole}

The goblins initially emerged from this tunnel, and can retreat through it if all else goes wrong.
It contains narrow passages and wide passages, and connections to the \gls{deep}.
It also presents a serious problem for the \glspl{pc}' mission, with very little solution -- the goblins can retreat down here, and the troupe will struggle to follow them.

Far below, a complete society of goblins lives beside volcanic vents, which grow verdant gardens.
The \glspl{pc} cannot hope to survive down here, and if they spend \pgls{interval} descending, they should figure out that they are going the wrong way.

\mapentry[skeinSwarm]{Skein Hole}

\begin{exampletext}
  Skein are skinny little lizards which live in caves.
  They have no eyes.
  Their little claws grasp smooth rocks like a spider.
  Their skin lets light through, and even the smallest glow of light causes them pain.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} pick the mushrooms,}
They will have enough supplies for five meals.
The cook will need \pgls{caveFire} and then makes an \roll{Intelligence}{Cultivation} roll (\tn[10]) to prepare them properly.

Rolling a tie indicates that the chef has failed, but will not poison anyone.
Failure indicates that the resulting rancid mushroom `stew', will not count as a full meal for anyone, and instead inflict 2~\glspl{ep}.

  Awakening the \glspl{basilisk} will almost certainly prove fatal.
  However, they take 3 rounds to awaken, so the \glspl{pc} may kill all of them before any consequences.

  \begin{boxtext}
    The matted knot of green flesh ahead sits like so many rocks.
    You cannot see a head, but you could never mistake that rancid stench -- some number of \glspl{basilisk} lie in a knotted pile.
  \end{boxtext}

  The troupe will be aware that \gls{basilisk} hides make some of the best armour, and the entire corpse can fetch a lot of money (although the \gls{templeOfBeasts} will ask them to use the funds to repay their debt).

  \Glspl{basilisk} hibernate here over \glsentrytext{cTwo}.
  Last snowfall, one \gls{basilisk} did not wake up, and so provided food for the entire caving system.

  \Pgls{swarm} of skein currently feast on the remains of the \gls{basilisk} corpse.
  As before, if the \glspl{pc} carry any source of light, they will attack; otherwise, they ignore them.

\wayOut{The not-so-distant light comes from}{sunRoof}

\mapentry[sunRoof]{Sun Roof}

This passage has had a cave-in, letting Sunlight \ifnum\value{temperature}=0 and snow \fi flood in through the top.
Unfortunately it still sits farther underground than a castle.

Climbing the ragged walls begins with an \roll{Intelligence}{Athletics} roll (\tn[10]), to understand the best route up.
A successful roll gives a further +2 Bonus to the main event: a \roll{Speed}{Athletics} check, \tn[14].
It also lets the player know the \gls{tn}.

A tie means the character figures out this climb will only hurt them before they climb.
A failed roll means the character falls 8~\glspl{step}.%

now is a good time to see if they survived.%

\mapentry[crackExit]{Exit Crack}

This sweet-smelling narrow tunnel goes forward and up, and eventually exits to the world above.
Unfortunately, it will only admit creatures with a Strength \gls{attribute} of 0 or less.

\wayOut{One more mile along is}{windyPassage}

\mapentry[windyPassage]{Windy Passage}

The wind coming through this tunnel invites the troupe out of the caverns, and back to \gls{fenestra}'s usual dangers.
