\noindent
This short adventure module stands alone, with everything you need to present it to players.
You have an overview of this world -- \glsentrytext{fenestra} -- \vpageref{mainGlossary}, and a short summary of the rules \vpageref{mechanicsGlossary}.

Take the short rules at the back of the book, and fold, fold, fold, until they form a booklet.
Then pierce the spine with a needle, and bind with floss.
This is the players' rules booklet.
