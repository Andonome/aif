\section{Mana Lakes}\label{mana_lake}\index{Mana Lakes}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
Throughout Fenestra there are little nodes where mana wells up from the ground like a wellspring.
In these locations, some number of MP is created each round which then raises the current MP of mages or nearby magical items.
Whoever has the most empty mana slots -- whether an item or a person -- gets that mana point.
It pours into the biggest vacuum like water into a hole.
So if a gnome with a current maximum of 6 MP spent 4 MP, that would mean they had a deficit of 4.
Another mage who had only spent 1 MP could only get a point after that gnome.\footnote{If two are tied for having the biggest deficit, ties are broken by the win going to the highest current maximum MP holder, then the highest Wits Attribute holder, then the highest Intelligence Bonus holder.}

Mana lakes also extend the range of all spells cast within to the entire mana lake at least as spells travel easily from one end to the other.  Each has a level, denoting the number of MP it doles out each round, so a mana lake of level 3 would give out 3 MP per round.

Magical items regenerate mana just like people do, so many miracle workers create magical items especially to sit in mana lakes, and recharge quickly.

A selection of such mana lakes with magical items (or some other permanent magical effect) are given below.
If your PCs encounter a mana lake on the Random Encounter tables, or you want one for one of your own stories, just pop one of the following into the map.

\manalake{King's Hand Valley}{Necromancy 4}{Divinity (Qualme)}{Instant}{Ranged Sentient Talisman}{+4}{9}{2}

There is a valley which was once filled with bandits who would pillage local villages.
To put a stop to it, a priest of Qualm\"{e} cursed it with a mummified hand of former Rex Dalius Quennome.\footnote{See page \pageref{h_dalius}.}
Nobody has any idea how he obtained the hand.

\begin{boxtext}

  Your arrow hits the bandit leader in the face, killing him instantly.
  The other duck down behind the hill, then screaming starts and all of them jump over the top, running towards you, despite your drawn bows.

  As you loose more arrows, you see the leader you shot stand back up with an arrow still protruding from his eye socket and blood smeared from his mouth downwards.
  Another stands up, his throat torn out, and both move quickly towards the bandits running towards you.

\end{boxtext}

If, at any time, a dead humanoid body is in the area, it rises from the dead to eat the souls of the living.  Most of the time such dead creatures like to stay and feast off the ambient magics in the area.  They hunker down under snow, or red, squelching leaves, or simply lie and let the moss grow over them.   At first impatient traders would attempt to sneak across the valley as a short cut.  Later, only a few brave warriors would come to test their strength.  Now none come, and the dead are being eaten away by the moss.  But they will not leave.  They simply remain, and wait to hear human speech again, and feel human warmth.  It has been a long time since their last meal and they have gathered a decade's worth of hunger.

The hand hangs from a tree, and looks very much like a hanging vine or a part of the tree it hangs from.
It holds a total of 7 MP and spends 2 to raise anyone in the area as a ghoul as per the second level of the necromancy sphere Calling the Dead.
It automatically activates instantly for as long as it has MP to use.

\manalake{The Petrified Forest}{Illusion 5}{Devotion (Alass\"{e})}{4 scenes}{Massive Sentient Artefact}{+5}{13}{1}

One day during the season of C\'{a}lea, a great flood came and washed a marsh clean out.  Mud trickled out for the entire season and when all was done, a petrified forest was uncovered.  Stone cylinders from one to six feet tall were uncovered throughout this mile long valley.  The valley is currently covered in grass and fungi but is otherwise uninhabited by any vegetation.

Around the centre of the valley, anyone mentioning something will soon see an illusion of that thing.  The illusions each have a total of 6 points to divide between Speed and Dexterity Bonuses, but have no other Traits.  People moving through might imagine what the forest was once like might see the petrified trees turning into real trees.  Those worrying about monsters will see an illusion of a monster.

The illusion holds 15 MP in total and can spend 3 at any point in order to create an illusion of up to 5 squares size.  Basic illusions are TN 11 to identify as illusions while larger illusions are only TN 9.

\manalake{The Myriad Web Forest}{Aldaron 3}{Devotion (Alass\"{e})}{2 scenes}{Talisman}{+4}{5}{1}

\begin{boxtext}

  You continue towards the sound of the crying deer, and brushing foliage aside you can finally see the great tree, a stone's throw away.
  Half way up the gargantuan tree, a giant, fat spider looks down, clasped to various branches.
  Beneath it, another giant spider is bound to the tree by a great web with two legs sticking out the side.
  Beside it, bears, deer, and one chitincrawler are trapped in more webbing, all around the tree.

  The bushes start to rustle, and man-sized arachnids pour out from every direction.

\end{boxtext}

In the middle of a great forest sits a massive and majestic Shiva tree.
A guardian spell was placed on it long ago by a priestess of Laiqu\"{e} such that if anyone enters the area, marauding animals are summoned to the area.
This is no problem to an initiate of Laiqu\"{e}, as they can typically charm such animals -- but anyone who was not a friend of the forest could be in serious trouble.

Since that time, a massive nura spider has taken up residence in the area.  This spider, grown to gargantuan size and twisted by strange magics, has made its home here.  It perpetually traps summoned animals in its web then eats them.  The summoned animals do not leave until they have been killed or leave the area.  However, the nura spider does not simply kill them but bind them with its web and slowly liquefies them with its poison.  This blurring of the boundaries of when the animal is dead or alive, of where the web ends and the creature begins, means that the animals so summoned remain after the spell has ended.

At any given time, its web is full of up to a half dozen assorted creatures -- griffins, aurochs, a bear and such.
The web must be laid slowly, but once on the ground or stretched between branches and tree trunks it is extremely strong.

During her time here, the spider has become incredibly large and fat and has given birth to many children.
Some move away to terrorise nearby farms.
Others remain and usually starve to death after failing to fight her for food.
She has one mate -- one male spider with whom she mates.
When hunger overcomes her she sometimes eats another section of his legs.
Currently, he has two and a half legs left.
He cannot move properly as she she has bound him in webbing and left him on branch near the top of the Shiva tree, hanging like her prey.
Every so often she approaches the top to mate with him, or to stop one of her children attempting to eat him.

\npc{\T\N}{8 Nura Spider Children}

\nuraspider

The Shiva tree holds 11 MP in total and can conjure animals as per the spell Forest's Call.

\manalake{The Wishing Wellspring}{Conjuration 5}{Alchemy}{6 scenes}{Sentient Artefact}{+6}{14}{1}

Long ago gnomes who lived near this area thought it would be fun to create a functioning wishing well for anyone who needed it.
They found a natural wellspring deep underground and created a layer of polished stone on top, complete with a gazebo.

In the centre of this stone floor placed in the middle of a large plain is the well.
The metal bucket and ropes were reinforced with steel wiring and function to this day, though they could do with being replaced.

\begin{boxtext}

  The wishing spring lies just ahead.
  The roof has deteriorated badly, but the stones laid all around still shine brightly.
  All the rocks are smooth, and as many are gemstones the entire platform glistens in the sunlight.
  Then you notice a foot sticking out the side.
  It belongs to a fat man whose face has been completely burnt off.

\end{boxtext}

Any time someone makes an audible wish, puts the well's bucket down and drops a coin into the well, a summoning spell activates and creates the thing they wished for inside the bucket.
When it is drawn back up, the wisher can grab the item.

Some time after the well's creation, a priest of Qualm\"{e} came and noted how some people were disrespecting the well and were using it too commonly.
Their wishes threatened to break the magic which allowed the well to function.
He decided to protect the well with a spell of his own.
He carved a message in elvish -- the tongue of all academics -- into the side of the well.
It proclaims ``Mine m'{e}re ilyain er'' -- ``Only one wish for everyone''.
The skull of an older priest of Qualm\"{e} was placed at the bottom of the well to guard against misuse.
If anyone attempts a second wish a storm of lightning and fire erupts from the well and spreads across a 5 square diameter, dealing $2D6+2$ Damage to everyone there.

The well holds a total of 16 MP and an use any of the first four levels of the Conjuration sphere.
If the well spends mana to summon an item, the mana must, of course, remain spent, so the well will be depleted by 3 MP for as long as the item remains in use.
If the well runs low on mana because too many people are making wishes, it simply cancels the oldest spell it has cast and the wished-for item disappears, whether it is by the well or a hundred leagues away.

\subsection{The Dwarvish Prophet}

\textit{Level: 3}

\noindent Deep underground there are many natural streams, flowing quickly into the depths.  Some of these run alongside passages which the dwarves carve out between the various realms they inhabit or realms they inhabited.  It is not uncommon for underground travellers to wander along natural caverns only to later find a dwarvish road to take them part of the journey.  On one of these roads is a carving of the face of a great dwarvish prophet.

\begin{boxtext}

  The massive face has no beard, leading almost everyone to believe she was female.
  A waterfall flows down her face and has worn down everything but the nose, leaving a single, perfect nose and part of the lips while the rest of the face looks more and more like bare rock with each passing decade.
  There are various possibilities as to who the face might represent -- there have been many dwarvish prophets and almost half were female, but the exact identity has never been discovered.

  As your guide passes through, runes around the statue's head glow.

  ``Exactly which happens is not well understood.'', he explains.

  ``Sometimes she blesses you, sometimes she curses you, and sometimes she does nothing at all.''

  ``Some say that spells themselves can become insane after long centuries sitting along in the dark.

  The guide wanders past, content with his fate.
  It's time for you to move past too.

\end{boxtext}

Those following the Codes of the Tribe or Experience receive $2D6$ FP (costing 2 MP).
Those following Qualm\"{e} or the Code of Acquisition lose $1D6+4$ FP.
Others are unaffected.
The statue head holds 12 MP in total.

\manalake{The Resting Grove}{Illusion 5}{Devotion (Alass\"{e})}{4 scenes}{Massive Sentient Artefact}{+5}{5}{2}

\begin{boxtext}

  Large, ripe fruits litter the forest clearing ahead, and short tufts of grass lay about and look perfect for sitting.
  Looking up, you suddenly notice various tree houses, with men looking down at you.

\end{boxtext}

This group of trees and bushes looks like a lucky find.  There are apples, blueberries, raspberries and tiny strawberries growing all around.  Even better, when one piece of fruit it picked, more grows in its place.  If it rains, the trees naturally knit their branches together  to form an overhead canopy thick enough to keep the rain out.  If people nestle up to their trunks, they can warp and open up, allowing people to sleep inside the newly created hollow.  The entire grove is a luxurious place which caters for the every need of anyone within, including creating simple items like tables or goblets out of wood.

Once people leave the area, any items they have remain as they were, but the trees return to normal.  Any items stored in those temporary shelters is absorbed by the tree, and further mutating magics will not necessarily bring the items back because the tree might not open out in the same way the second time it opens.

While this place was once a welcome resting stop for many a traveller, or at least for those brave enough to go near such strange magics, it has since been taken over by bandits.
They use the trees as a continuous supply of arrows for their bows.
They sit in tree houses at the top and shoot down to any attempting to get them out of the area.
Since the grove is not far from a major road, the local town master has made a high price on the bandits' heads.
None have claimed the bounty yet.

\humanarcher[\npc{\T}{12 Bandits}]

The grove contains 13 MP in total and spends 4 in order to make any alteration or 1 MP to calm any wild animal in the area.
All spells cast count as having an Intelligence Bonus of +3.

\section{Magical Items}
\label{magicalitems}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
Magical items are fairly formulaic since each path of magic has a limited number of `mana stones' which they can make, and a limited number of spells.
Nevertheless a few examples sit here for quick reference.

\subsection{Alchemical Items}

\magicitem{Bag of Tricks}% NAME
  {Metamorphosis}% SPELL
  {Alchemy}% PATH
  {3 scenes}% DURATION
  {Talisman}% TYPE
  {3}% Potency
  {5}% MP

This gem-studded bag has a tough, silver chord around the top, and won't open more than the width of a man's wrist.
By simply naming an object, people can pull out any number of objects.
Unfortunately, the bag only speaks the gnomish language.

It stores 5 MP, and spends one produce nearly any small, valueless item or substance, with the full use of the fourth level of Conjuration.

\label{bagOfHolding}
\magicitem{Bag of Holding}% NAME
  {Gate}% SPELL
  {Alchemy}% PATH
  {Eternal}% DURATION
  {Eternal Pocket Spell}% TYPE
  {5}% Potency
  {1}% MP

This looks identical to the bag of tricks, but instead of summoning items, the opening of the bag is a magical portal which leads to someone's closet.

Exactly how much space is available depends upon how long the user's arm is.  Inside is completely dark, and the folds of the bag (or perhaps further magic) do not allow anyone to peer into the bag -- only to fondle the various shelves resting inside.

Anyone putting an item into the bag must make a Dexterity + Crafts check at TN 6 or risk dropping the item instead of placing it on one of the dark shelves within.

Those holding the bag generally have no idea how it works, as the closet has a \textit{Cloak} spell cast over it, preventing any light from entering.
However, they may notice that items move, ever-so-slightly, from time to time.
The home-owner is a gnomish alchemist, who initially sent out the bag to spy on the world and hunt for interesting magical items.
People always put their most valued treasures in this bag, and if he thinks the user has died, he takes the item.

\magicitem{The Townmaster's Hat}% NAME
  {Colourful Cloak}% SPELL
  {Alchemy}% PATH
  {4 Scenes}% DURATION
  {Item}% TYPE
  {4}% Potency
  {2}% MP

Townmaster James of Whiteplains was especially scared of assassination during the time of Rex Dalius, so he commissioned four hats with an illusion, making anyone who put them on look exactly like him.
He has since died, and the hats have been used by various thieves to disguise their identity.

\magicitem{Portal Scroll}% NAME
  {Fast, Ranged, Gate}% SPELL
  {Alchemy}% PATH
  {2 Scenes}% DURATION
  {Pocket Spell}% TYPE
  {2}% Potency
  {7}% MP

\label{portalscroll}

Once read aloud, the scroll opens a magical \textit{Gate} to wherever the creator stood at the time the scroll 
The portal remains open for 2 scenes, then vanishes.

The creation involves a complex process, which even the most skilled alchemists struggle to comprehend.

Sensible mages might use this ability to create a portal home, in case of emergencies, but other portal scrolls exist which go to less safe places, such as \nameref{shiftingcorridors}.

\subsection{Divine Items}

\magicitem{The Sleeping Cat}% NAME
  {Fast Sleep}% SPELL
  {Devotion (Laiqu\"{e})}% PATH
  {3 Scene}% DURATION
  {Talisman}% TYPE
  {3}% Potency
  {5}% MP

A priest of Laiqu\"{e} once left all her worldly mana to a cat, imbuing it with a single spell.
The cat can instinctively make animals of any kind fall asleep.
He sometimes uses this to hunt mice, and sometimes to shut people up who are too loud.

  \end{enumerate}
  \end{multicols}
\end{boxtext}
\end{figure*}

This deck, presumably fashioned by various priests of Alass\"{e}, holds a number of cards.
Once grasped between \emph{three} or more fingers, the card activates.
If it's held, the target is the caster.
If thrown, the target is whoever the caster throws it at (the caster doesn't need to be a good thrower for the magic to work).

Each card looks much like a normal playing card, with one non-obvious flaw, such as a joker who's wet himself, or a king who's lost his crown.  The spells are each cast with an effective Intelligence and Wits bonus of +4.  Only a few cards remain.  Once one is pulled, the effects activate immediately and lasts for a full scene.

The Deck of Cards resists all magic, including gaining information about it through Fate.

\label{godslayer}

If the sword ever inflicts 12 or more Damage on an opponent (before DR is applied), it can erupt with an invocation spell, inflicting an additional $1D6 + 1$ Damage.

This flute, made of a basilisk's femur, can be played to lull any animal into a state of confusion.

Once the spell has completed, the target remains as a bird until sundown.

The tree regenerates 3 per scene.

\magicitem{Shield Tattoo}% NAME
  {Mage Armour}% SPELL
  {Runes}% PATH
  {Continuous}% DURATION
  {Talisman}% TYPE
  {2}% Potency
  {3}% MP

This tattoo, placed across one's chest, allows a shield of energy to be activated at just the right time.
The \textit{Mage Armour} spell prohibits any attacks, so the user must time the spell's use properly -- specifically, the spell is useless if one wants to attack.

It casts the spell at level 3, so with a \textit{Potence} of 3, it provides ($3\times3+2$) 11 SP.

This magical Talisman became such a popular thing to cast that people often now tear out the hearts of blood casters to see if they can use the heart as a magical item.
With proper preservation, the heart will continue to function, but as with any Sentient spell, it will do as it pleases, which depends upon its Code.

  {Continuous}% DURATION
  {Sentient Talisman}% TYPE
  {3}% Potency

\section{Random Starting Conditions}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
For players who want some inspiration for their character's background, or just more randomness, and for GMs looking for a little inspiration for their NPCs, there is a table of Random Starting Conditions.  If you want to offer this to your players, tell them to roll 1D100 and read the result to the player.  Remind players that if they are going to roll then they should be ready to accept both good and bad results; this system is here to provide an interesting result, not a beneficial one.

If the player rolls twice and achieves two re-rolls, they may find their parents died twice -- this is fine.
Grandparents, god parents and adopted parents all count as parents; other examples may have to be modified to retain consistency.
No more than three starting conditions should be applied, no matter how many times the player achieves a re-roll.

\iftoggle{core}{%
  If two players obtain the same result, they share the same background, as per, `\nameref{sharedstories}'.\footnote{See the core rules, page \pageref{sharedstories}.}
  If their parents were both killed in the same event then they are from the same village or perhaps siblings.
  They might both have worked on a similar job or share a magical item which they found at the same time.

  Every second story you tell using your Story Points must involve either Nura, the undead or mad mages studying forbidden magics.
  If you know a blacksmith, he might be a hermetical nura hobgoblin living alone in the forest and coming out to trade wares.
  If you know a cut-throat, this might be an ogre who has managed to survive by convincing a village to constantly deliver meat to him.

  you now have a crippling phobia of this creature (if the result is a mana lake, reroll).

  You were hired for a battle with a powerful priestess of Qualm\"{e} but were so terrified of her undead host that you fled before the battle.
  While fleeing, you accidentally encountered the undead host on the road and had to hide in the surrounding forest.
  Then the host stopped, and the priestess left her wagon in a forest clearing before continuing towards the battle.
  After you were sure they were gone, you crept up to the wagon and stole the first thing you could see -- a painted skull, sitting on the table.
  Since then you learnt two things -- that all of your companions are dead (and you have been presumed dead with them) and that the skull you stole comes from an old priest of Qualm\"{e}.
  His spirit remains in the skull.
  He cannot speak but can summon the dead back to life.
  He has a base MP of 6, Intelligence 3, Wits 1, Necromancy level 5, Invocation level 3, Fate 2 and Aldaron 1.
  He can affect someone with \textit{Death Sight}, at which point the target can see and hear the necromancer.
  His current wish is to return to a priest of Qualm\"{e}.
  He is not a cooperative magical item for others' use but a creature in his own right.
  He has only a limited fear of death as returning to this land would be difficult but not impossible.

  It follows you on foot.

  You once destroyed a powerful artefact from some temple -- perhaps a sacred tree in a temple of Laiqu\"{e}, or a doll from a temple to Alass\"e.
  Whether this was on purpose or by accident, that god now has it in for you.  Every time you are outside of a city and obtain a result of `no encounter' the GM re-rolls once in order to try and obtain an encounter.

  You are addicted to alcohol.
  Any time you have a strong drink -- ale does not count -- you must make a Wits roll, TN 8; failure indicates you must have another drink.

  Your grandmother, high priestess of Laiqu\"{e}, died recently and made you promise to look after the family cat.

  It has a range of 6 squares and uses your late grandmother's Intelligence bonus of 2.
  The cat has Str -5, Spd 4, Dex 2, Int 0, Wts 2, Cha 3.

  Your back still bears the runic-scars.
  Unfortunately for them, two things went wrong -- the first is that you were not actually dead when the spell started (just close to death), the second is that other dwarves came to interrupt the illegal ritual and kill the necromancer.
  They set you free, the spell completed but with a strange twist.
  If ever you die, that powerful spirit shall return and inhabit your body with full access to powerful spells and begin amassing an army and increasing his own personal power by drinking the souls of the dead.
  The dwarves explained to you that they thought this was a likely result but let you go because you were not guilty of any crime.

  You enlisted to fight with one of the most famous heroes of the land -- Elric Redthirst, paladin of Ohta, to fight against encroaching nura horrors.

  The forces were so equally matched that everyone died -- everyone except you.
  You picked up Elric's sword -- a beautiful yet simple thing made from the finest steel, enchanted to destroy any creature.
  It is known as The God Slayer (see page \pageref{godslayer}).
  If the church of Ohta find out you have taken the sword, they will hunt you to the ends of the earth for it.
  At present, nobody knows you well enough to be looking for you -- they probably assume that some nura survived and stole the artefact.

  This uses any level of the illusion sphere, up to 5th, and counts as if it were cast by someone with Intelligence and Wits 5.
  The GM crafts a dream out of elements and characters from the current adventure and from your background stories -- if you have already specified you have known a blacksmith from childhood and you are currently running away from nura creatures, that blacksmith might arrive after having been transformed into an ogre.
