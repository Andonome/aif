{Easy Job}% NAME
{\Pgls{jotter} needs the troupe to kill \pgls{basilisk}}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  Farmers have found claw-marks in the earth, showing something tearing up the soil, not far from their \gls{village}.
  Working in the field around the \gls{village}, a stench came on the wind so bad that many buckled.
  At night, they hear roaring noises.
\end{exampletext}

The \gls{jotter} congratulates the troupe on their mission, and mentions that \gls{basilisk} bodies can fetch a good price, and reminds them that half of the sale goes to the \gls{templeOfBeasts}.
The \gls{village} in question is fifteen miles down the road, so they'd best get moving.

\iftoggle{intro}{
  \paragraph{If \pgls{pc} asks for better \glspl{weapon},}
  they can roll \roll{Charisma}{Empathy} at \tn[10].
  Success means the \emph{player} should interpret how the character might ask for free equipment.

  \paragraph{If \pgls{pc} chats to other \glspl{guard} in the \gls{broch},}
  \gls{gDigger}~\composeHumanName\ laughs at the notion of \pgls{basilisk} roaring.

  \begin{speechtext}
    \Glspl{monster} don't roar.
    That's why people call them `the voiceless'.
  \end{speechtext}
}{}


\segment[\gls{afternoon}]{lonelyRoad}% AREA
{The Dry Valley}% NAME
{A trader asks the troupe to stay the night}% SUMMARY

The dry valley never floods, even during \pgls{storm}.
Caverns down to the \gls{deep} swallow the water before it can rise too high.

\begin{boxtext}
  Two plumes of smoke rise over the tall trees in the distance.
  After a mile, the road descends into the Dry Valley, and the trees open for a blessed moment.
  The distant smoke comes from \pgls{village}, over five miles away.
  The second comes from \pgls{bothy}, a little down the road, where two men push a donkey into a cart.

  Going down the road, the trees crowd around again, obscuring everything.
\end{boxtext}

Ten traders stay in the \gls{bothy}, with three carts.
They have no \glspl{guard} with them, so once they see the \glspl{pc} they begin asking a thousand questions, and speaking in a friendly manner, hoping the \glspl{pc} will stay and watch their animals overnight.
The \gls{bothy} barely has enough room for the ten traders, so they have to take all the vegetables from the \gls{village} out to make room for their horses and donkeys to sleep in some safety.

\iftoggle{intro}{
  If the \glspl{pc} have \pgls{torch}, they can press on and make the \gls{village} that night.
  However, any light they have (or noise they make) may attract nearby \glspl{monster} ($\frac{1}{\dicef{6}}$ chance).
}{}

Traders \composeHumanName\ and \composeHumanName\ have little to sell, but if the troupe need food, they can offer \rations, \rations, or \rations\ for \mkPrice[cp]{21} each.

\currentName\ mourns her old dwarf-friend --- Dent --- who protected her and her caravan the last time she came, five days ago.
He ran into the forest, shouting something about `wyrmsign', and nobody heard of him since.

\segment[\squash~\gls{night}]{lonelyRoad}% AREA
{Dank Night}% NAME
{Something wanders the forest, and it reeks}% SUMMARY

Whether the \glspl{pc} sleep in the \gls{bothy} or not, a stench comes during the night.
The smell upsets the stomach, and inflicts \pgls{ep} on each character.
Nearby animals begin to panic.
The troupe will not sleep well, so they must take another \gls{ep} due to the dreamless night.

If the \glspl{pc} rush out to find the source of the smell, find it on \gls{segment}~\vref{irregularDragon}.

\thread{The Condition}

\segment{Forest}% AREA
{Wyrmsign}% NAME
{The troupe find patches of torn-up earth}% SUMMARY

Patches of earth have been torn up by massive claws.
An \roll{Intelligence}{Medicine} at \tn[12] tells \pgls{pc} that someone's looking for mushrooms to make \pgls{elixir}.

The troupe can follow the claw-marks to the maker, five miles away.%
\footnote{See \vref{irregularDragon}.}
They roll \roll{Wits}{Survival} at \tn[6], but failure means they become lost.

\segment{Forest}% AREA
{Grounded Dragon}% NAME
{He will not leave until someone makes \pgls{elixir}}% SUMMARY

\label{irregularDragon}

Approaching the dragon, the troupe may see flame-marks on trees --- as the dragon tries to alleviate himself, he often lets out a little flame.

\begin{boxtext}
  Ahead, nestled among the trees, a mass of green scales writhe around its own bloated stomach.
  Claws caress and push into the ballooned abdomen.
  The shoulders and tail twitch.
  The \gls{fiend} stares hatefully, with bright-yellow eyes.
\end{boxtext}

\begin{speechtext}
  Do not flee.
  I will not harm you.
  I have needs.

  There is a cave-mouth, not too far from here.
  Willow trees surround it, but keep their distance, making the shape of an eye.

  I can no longer fit inside, my stomach has become so heavy.
  Go there, to the cave mouth, and descend until the smell of lilacs.
  This smell comes from a mushroom.
  Cut that mushroom down, and return with a barrel's worth of the cap.

  I must have \pgls{elixir} from that mushroom's cap, so I can fly again.
\end{speechtext}

\dragon

\paragraph{Any rude speech}
results in a single shot of flame from the dragon.

{A Long Way to Mushrooms}% NAME
{The troupe descend, next to a growing river}% SUMMARY


% Mushroom meeting

\end{document}


## Background
- Each time the dragon tries and fails to burp or fart, the pressure builds in his abdomen, then he belches fire.

### 1) Strange Noises (Bailey)
- People hear noises sounding...
  - like an asthmatic motorbike.
  - like a newborn thundercloud, squealing.
  - like bedsheets being torn open.
- A jotter orders the PCs to get rid of the noises.

### 2) Murmurs in the Deep (Woods)
- Getting in the direction of the noises and moving against the wind inflicts 1 EP per interval, because the PCs need to move through a dense cloud of toxic and malodour cloud of dragon sickness-farts.
- The roars and farts echo through the cavern. Finding the entrance requires good auditory orientation (maybe multiple entrances exist?) 

### 3) Double Shot (Cavern)
- The dragon suffers from constipations. He can barely move and his only way to release some of the pressure is through uncontrolled belches and farts.
- The lair is filled with a mix of stomach-twisting body gases.
- The dragons ask the PCs to gather laxative mushrooms growing further down the cavern.

### 4) Laxative Mushrooms (Cavern)
- The dragon farts enrich flammable methane inside the cavern.
- The mushrooms are sentient (which effects do they have?)
