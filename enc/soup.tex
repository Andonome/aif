\begin{speechtext}
  Old Carnpox was old when I was young, and she's still old.
  \Pgls{witch} is one thing, but she's something else.
  She doesn't buy or sell.
  No need for civilization.
  She's dangerous.

  I sent \pgls{ranger} to deal with her, then two more.
  None of them returned.
  She must know that I sent them.
  She would never let them die without knowing, so she knows.

  So now I'm deep in debt.
  I hope this box works.
  It cost so much that it has to\ldots

{The Parcel}% NAME
{The troupe must deliver a box, unopened, to \pgls{hag}}% SUMMARY

\pagestyle{minizine}%

\Gls{susjot} figures that Granny Carnpox can detect murderous intent, so he finds the most clueless and unassuming people in the \gls{broch} to deliver the box.

\begin{speechtext}
  Got a special parcel to deliver.
  Simple mission, and the temple's happy to pay two \glsentrylongpl{sp} each.
  Just take this wooden box to old Carnpox, unopened.
  She lives just past \carnBothy.
  You understand about keeping the box shut, and delivering the box to her, still shut, and \emph{not} opened.
  Am I making sense?
\end{speechtext}

\Gls{susjot} quizzes the troupe about the mission, to make sure they understand how to not open a box.
If a \underline{player} says they will open the box, \gls{susjot} hears the \gls{pc}, and declares they're no longer on the mission
(the player must select another \gls{pc}).

\segment{bothy}% AREA
{Halfway House}% NAME
{The \glsfmttext{bothy} has no firewood}% SUMMARY

\carnBothy\ stands eight miles down the \gls{lonelyRoad}.
It has no firewood, just an axe.
Nobody else arrives, so the \glspl{pc} have a simple decision --- go cut wood (and make noise) in the night, or don't.
If they cut wood, they can restock the \gls{bothy}.
\ifnum\value{temperature}=0
  Without wood, they sleep in the cold, and take \pgls{ep} in the morning.

After the troupe leave Granny Carnpox's place, they meet three \glspl{ranger} on the road, riding horses.
The \glspl{ranger} ask them how the mission went.
If the troupe have opened the box, the \glspl{ranger} sigh as they deduce \gls{susjot}'s plan.
The \glspl{ranger} should --- by law --- take them to town for prosecution.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{pitOfJustice}
However, if the \glspl{pc} agree to return to \carnBothy\ with Carnpox' head, the \glspl{ranger} will wait for a day.

If the troupe attack the \glspl{ranger}, the \glspl{ranger} turn their horses and flee.
The horses spend \pgls{ap} to turn, and one more to move.

\subsection{Granny's House}

\begin{boxtext}
  A narrow foot-path, a mile from the \gls{bothy}, leads through the forest.
  A man's voice comes from somewhere ahead.
  He wants to know, \textit{`what's in the box?'}.
\end{boxtext}

The voice is Rentfold.
He has no arms, and no legs, just a stylish moustache.%
\footnote{Rentfold worked as \pgls{ranger}, but when he tried to kill Granny Carnpox, chef Gorflake cut his legs open, then cut them off, then the arms.}

\noindent
Rentfold has a symbiotic relationship with a beakless \gls{woodspy} called `Baxter'.
Granny cut out Baxter's beak to enhance her \glspl{spell}, but kept the \gls{woodspy} alive.
Now it goes everywhere with Rentfold, lifting him up as they travel.
Baxter lies nearby, camouflaged perfectly into the forest.

Coinfilch asks the troupe if they have come for the evening soup.

\begin{speechtext}
  What's in the box?
  A delivery?
  I'm the official letter writer here, so I'm basically in charge of Granny's post.
  Yea, that looks like postage.
  Open it up, let me see!
\end{speechtext}

Nettlepike happily explains that he's a bad man because he tried to stab Granny.
He can tell them what happened to Coinfilch and Rentfold, if the \glspl{pc} ask.
However, he can't think very clearly, as he relates every sentence to letters he once wrote, and has a lot of trouble speaking about anything not concerned with writing.

\paragraph{One mile from the cottage}
the forest opens, revealing the cottage, and Carnpox' garden.

\begin{boxtext}
  The forest ends suddenly.
  A mile away, a wattle cottage with a smoking chimney stands in the centre of dead, grassless, earth.
  You stand in the outer ring, full of berries, carrots, and a peach tree which literally drips with sweet juice as the fat peaches have split open.
\end{boxtext}

\begin{exampletext}
  As Granny makes plants grow with witchcraft, it decreases the soil's fertility, so she must grow further away.
  Her magical gardens push out a ring of death, which becomes wider each year.
\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{Half a mile away}
Granny Carnpox spies the crew, and casts her usual \gls{spell}, which detects if someone has murderous intent.
And if they do, she rallies the troupes, secretively, and quietly, while leaving through the back door.

\paragraph{At the cottage}
Rentfold sits on the roof (his symbiotic \gls{woodspy} lies camouflaged into the wattle beside him).
He points (by pursing his lips) to the weapons rack by the gnome-sized door; it holds a single, rusted, greatsword.
He tells the \glspl{pc} to place their weapons upon it.
He does not reveal how he got on the roof.

\subsubsection{Inside the cottage}
chef Gorflake cooks for granny.%
\footnote{Gorflake once tried to poison Granny, so she's `teaching him how to cook'.}
He has a special procedure to turn around without his fat stomach throwing everything off the table, and another procedure to get to the shelves on the other side of the room (it begins with putting his stomach on the table, and pulling it inwards, then shuffling round the side of the room).
Gorflake cannot leave the cottage through the front door.

By the fire, `the Whittler' whittles.
He can't remember his own name, or what he did wrong, he just knows he has to make a complete set of bowls and cutlery for Granny Carnpox.
If he completes this task, the enchantment wears off, and he will leave.
But every time someone has soup, they throw the bowl and spoon into the fire.

Over the fire, a massive pot simmers with eternal soup.
\Gls{chef}~Carnpox adds ingredients, people drink, he adds some more.
It changes a little bit every day.

Movement inside the room demands a \roll{Dexterity}{Athletics} check (\gls{tn} equals the character's \glspl{hp} $+3$).
Failure will knock something off a shelf, inflicting \dmg{-2}~Damage.

The next room is where Granny Carnpox stays.

\subsubsection{At Sundown}
everyone arrives to eat the soup, and every second person raises the \gls{tn} to move.
Coinfilch leaves hair everywhere.
Nettlepike complains that the wrong food will make his ink-gland produce weird colours.
Rentfold chews up chunks of meat, and spits them into Baxter's beakless maw.
The Whittler eats, then cries quietly as everyone burns their bowls after the meal.
Two cats arrive and meow loudly outside, but Granny won't let them eat until everyone else has finished.
These are Granny's `special little boys', modified with \glspl{spell} to grow big and strong.

\morphcat[\npc{\T[2]\A\R}{Cats: Gorgeous \& Rainfall}]

Finishing the soup requires \pgls{bandAct} roll of \roll{Strength}{Athletics} at \tn[10].
Once done, Coinfilch and Gorflake are free of their oaths; their Mind \gls{attribute} Penalties vanish and they may help the troupe.

\subsubsection{Opening the box}\label{insideTheBox}
requires untying the complex knot at the front: \roll{Intelligence}{Seafaring} (\tn[10]).
Inside, \pgls{crossbow} waits, loaded.
The steel bow stays rigid, dwarven beard makes an unbreakable string.
The white arrowheads gleam, all three made from quartz which shatters on impact.

The arrows inflicts \dmg{6}~Damage (helmets have a $\frac{2}{\dicef{6}}$ chance to negate all Damage).
Once the bolts fly, a scroll unfurls across the box's open lid:

\begin{speechtext}
  This device was manufactured by Nanpa.
  Nanpa is remains \gls{temple}-neutral, and is not responsible for the use, misuse, or consequences of this device.
  If you would like to purchase a similar device for the return address, or any other address, send a detailed letter to Nanpa via the \gls{paperGuild} in \gls{ftown}.
\end{speechtext}

Resetting the box-\gls{crossbow} requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Crafts} roll at \tn[12].
