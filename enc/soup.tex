\noindent
\Pgls{doula} has retired to a little cottage a few decades ago.
She should be dead by now, but she's not playing by the rules.

\Pgls{susjot} decided to mount a surprise attack, before she becomes a problem, but the \glspl{ranger} he sent to kill her haven't returned.
So he felt worried, and did something desperate: he contacted a gnomish trap-maker, who made him a box to deliver to Granny Carnpox.
Find the box on \autopageref{insideTheBox}.

\segment[\gls{morning}]{broch}% AREA
{The Parcel}% NAME
{The troupe must deliver a box, unopened, to \pgls{hag}}% SUMMARY

\pagestyle{minizine}%

Every dawn, a piper stands at the top of the \gls{broch} and blows his pipes.
Any \gls{pc} capable of using \pgls{bow} can (and must) stand at the top, waiting for any \gls{monster} which comes from the forest.
No \glspl{monster} come today, but \pgls{susjot} has a mission for them:

\begin{speechtext}
  Got a special parcel to deliver here.
  Simple mission, and the temple's happy to pay two silver each (taken off your debt).
  Just deliver this wooden box to old Carnpox, unopened.
  You understand about keeping the box shut, and delivering the box to her, still shut, and \emph{not} opened.
  Am I making sense?
\end{speechtext}

\Gls{susjot} quizzes the troupe about the mission, to make sure they understand how to not open a box.
If a player says they're opening the box, \gls{susjot} hears the \gls{pc}, and tells them they're no longer on the mission
(the player must select another \gls{pc}).

The path to Carnpox' cottage lies eight miles away, close to \pgls{bothy}.

\segment{bothy}% AREA
{Halfway House}% NAME
{The \glsfmttext{bothy} has no firewood}% SUMMARY

The troupe find \composeHumanName~\gls{bothy} has no firewood, just an axe.
Nobody joins them, so they have a simple decision -- go cut wood (and make noise) in the night, or don't.
If they cut wood, they can restock the \gls{bothy}%
\ifnum\value{temperature}=0
  , otherwise they sleep in the cold, and take \pgls{ep}.
\else%
  .\footnote{Check for random encounters in the \textit{Almanac}.}
\fi

\segment{lonelyRoad}% AREA
{Mission Report}% NAME
{Two \glspl{ranger} ask the troupe how their mission with the box went}% SUMMARY

After the troupe leave Granny Carnpox's place, they meet three \glspl{ranger} on the road, riding horses.
The \glspl{ranger} ask them how the mission went.

\humansoldier[\npc{\T[3]\Hu\M\F}{\composeHumanName, \composeHumanName, \& \composeHumanName}]

\horse[\npc{\T[3]\A}{Horses}]

If the troupe have opened the box themselves, the \glspl{ranger} explain the horrible situation they are in.
The \glspl{ranger} should --- by law --- take them to town for prosecution.
However, they are willing to wait for a day at \pgls{broch} instead.
If the troupe can kill Granny Carnpox and bring her head to the \gls{broch}, the \glspl{ranger} make the report to \pgls{jotter}, and make sure they receive a good payment.
If the troupe don't manage to return, they will face prosecution in \pgls{court}, and probable hanging.

If the troupe attack the \glspl{ranger}, the \glspl{ranger} turn their horses and flee.
The horses spend \pgls{ap} to turn, and one more to move.

\subsection{Granny's House}

\begin{boxtext}
  A narrow foot-path, a mile from the \gls{bothy}, leads through the forest.
  A man's voice comes from somewhere ahead.
  He wants to know, \textit{`what's in the box?'}.
\end{boxtext}

The voice is Rentfold.
He has no arms, and no legs, just a stylish moustache.%
\footnote{Rentfold worked as \pgls{ranger}, but when he tried to kill Granny Carnpox, chef Gorflake cut his legs open, then cut them off, then the arms.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item\sf
  How did you get here?
  \item\it
  Magic.
  What's in the box?
  Are you here for the soup?
  \item\sf
  Who did your moustache?
  \item\it
  My elf-girlfriend.
  Who sent you?
\end{itemize}

Rentfold has a symbiotic relationship with \pgls{woodspy} called `Baxter', who lost its beak.
Granny used Baxter's beak as \pgls{ingredient}, but kept the \gls{woodspy} alive.
Now it goes everywhere with Rentfold, lifting him up as they travel.
Baxter lies nearby, camouflaged perfectly into the forest.

\paragraph{Three miles from the cottage}
the troupe meet a hairy creature, prowling for mushrooms.%
\footnote{Coinfilch and her crew came to kill Granny in her sleep.
Granny inverted their hair, then left them to catch fire while moving through her cottage's cramped kitchen.}
Her naked, perfectly human mouth speaks normally, but the rest of the face has hair all over it.
She has no clothes -- just thick, brown and white hair covering her whole body, except where humans normally have hair.

The `ink' comes from a \gls{crawler} spinneret, embedded in his abdomen.

\begin{speechtext}

  A delivery?
  I'm the official letter writer here, so I'm basically in charge of Granny's post.
  Yea, that looks like postage.
  Open it up, let me see!
\end{speechtext}

Nettlepike happily explains that he's a bad man because he tried to stab Granny.
He can tell them what happened to Coinfilch and Rentfold, if the \glspl{pc} ask.
However, he can't think very clearly, as he relates every sentence to letters he once wrote, and has a lot of trouble speaking about anything not concerned with writing.

\paragraph{One mile from the cottage}
the forest opens, revealing the cottage, and Carnpox' garden.

\begin{boxtext}
  The forest ends suddenly.
  A mile away, a wattle cottage with a smoking chimney stands in the centre of dead, grassless, earth.
  You stand in the outer ring, full of berries, carrots, and a peach tree which literally drips with sweet juice as the fat peaches have split open.
\end{boxtext}

\begin{exampletext}
  As Granny makes plants grow with witchcraft, it decreases the soil's fertility, so she must grow further away.
  Her magical gardens push out a ring of death, which becomes wider each year.
\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{Half a mile away}
Granny Carnpox spies the crew, and casts her usual \gls{spell}, which detects if someone has murderous intent.
And if they do, she rallies the troupes, secretively, and quietly, while leaving through the back door.

\paragraph{At the cottage}
Rentfold sits on the roof (his symbiotic \gls{woodspy} lies camouflaged into the wattle beside him).
He points (by pursing his lips) to the weapons rack by the gnome-sized door; it holds a single, rusted, greatsword.
He tells the \glspl{pc} to place their weapons upon it.
He does not reveal how he got on the roof.

\subsubsection{Inside the cottage}
chef Gorflake cooks for granny.%
\footnote{Gorflake once tried to poison Granny, so she's `teaching him how to cook'.}
He has a special procedure to turn around without his fat stomach throwing everything off the table, and another procedure to get to the shelves on the other side of the room (it begins with putting his stomach on the table, and pulling it inwards, then shuffling round the side of the room).
Gorflake cannot leave the cottage through the front door.

By the fire, `the Whittler' whittles.%
He can't remember his own name, or what he did wrong, he just knows he has to make Granny a complete set of bowls and cutlery for Granny Carnpox before he leaves.
But every time someone has soup, they throw the bowl and spoon into the fire.
If he ever finishes this task, the enchantment \gls{spell} wears off, and he will leave.

Over the fire, a massive pot simmers with eternal soup.
The chef adds ingredients, people drink, he adds some more.
It changes a little bit every day.

Movement inside the room demands a \roll{Dexterity}{Athletics} check at \tn[8].
Failure will knock something off a shelf, inflicting \dmg{-2}~Damage.

The next room is where Granny Carnpox stays.

\subsubsection{At Sundown}
everyone arrives to eat the soup, and every new person raises the \gls{tn} to move.
Coinfilch leaves hair everywhere.
Nettlepike complains that the wrong food will make his ink-gland produce weird colours.
Rentfold chews up chunks of meat, and spits them into Baxter's beakless maw.
The Whittler eats, then cries quietly as everyone burns their bowls after the meal.
Two cats arrive and meow loudly outside, but Granny won't let them eat until everyone else has finished.
These are Granny's `special little boys', modified with \glspl{spell} to grow big and strong.

\morphcat[\npc{\T[2]\A\R}{Cats: Gorgeous \& Rainfall}]

Finishing the soup requires \pgls{bandAct} roll of \roll{Strength}{Athletics} at \tn[10].
Once done, Coinfilch and Gorflake are free of their oaths; their Mind \gls{attribute} Penalties vanish and they may help the troupe.

\subsubsection{Opening the box}\label{insideTheBox}
requires untying the complex knot at the front: \roll{Intelligence}{Seafaring} (\tn[10]).
Inside, \pgls{crossbow} waits, loaded.
The steel bow stays rigid, dwarven beard makes an unbreakable string.
The white arrowheads gleam, all three made from quartz.

The arrows inflicts \dmg{6}~Damage.
A helmet has a 3-in-6 chance of negating all Damage.

Inside, a letter from \gls{susjot}.

\begin{speechtext}
  Find any valuables and place them inside the box.
  Hide it in the forest, ten steps from the path.
