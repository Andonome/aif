\segment[\gls{morning}]{lonelyRoad}% AREA
{Patience}% NAME
{\Pgls{crawler} observes patiently}% SUMMARY

The air is calm; the troupe receive only 2~\glspl{mp} this day.

If confronted, it flees.

\segment[\gls{night}]{village}% AREA
{Payment}% NAME
{\Pgls{crawler} attacks at night}% SUMMARY

Rain beats the ground, and the \gls{crawler} from earlier comes to visit the \gls{village}.
If the \glspl{pc} make any noise (or have any light) it attacks them.
Otherwise, it enters the \gls{village}, climbing the wall, and then begins to feel around the houses for an opening.
The \glspl{pc} may hear the sound of crying children over the rain, but they won't hear the \gls{crawler}.


\segment[\gls{afternoon}]{lonelyRoad}% AREA
{Greater Deals}% NAME
{Cindercough returns}% SUMMARY

A lightning storm builds.
By evening, it will break, and each \gls{round} has a 1 in 6 chance of lightning providing light for the \glspl{pc} to see by.
The energy provides 4~\glspl{mp} throughout the \gls{interval}.

But for now, a wagon approaches.

\segment[\gls{morning}]{broch}% AREA
{Carrying the Fallen}% NAME
{\Gls{ranger} Cainboak needs urgent medical care}% SUMMARY

The piper drones as the Sun rises slowly.
The muddy-orange light shines down on a crawling shape the size of a wagon, approaching the \gls{broch} at a gallop.

The \gls{broch} has \glspl{bow} for everyone's use, so the \glspl{pc} can aim from the balcony.
Once the \gls{crawler} approaches, the \glspl{pc} can aim at \tn[12], but need to hit \tn[17] for \pgls{vitalShot}.

If the \glspl{pc} kill the \gls{crawler}, \gls{jotter} Carndug values the corpse at \arabic{gold}~\glspl{sp}, takes
\roundUp{gold}
\arabic{gold}~\glspl{sp} for the \gls{templeOfBeasts}, divides
\set{gold}{xp}\divide\value{gold} by 2%
\addtocounter{gold}{0}%
\arabic{gold}~\glspl{sp} among the \glspl{pc}, then takes back the \glsentrylongpl{sp} to repay their debt.

Finally, he hands them a `town-pass', stating they may enter town for a day.
Their mission is to approach a nearby \gls{bothy}, where \gls{ranger} Cainboak lies on the ground, badly wounded.
They must take him back to town, unharmed.

The \gls{bothy} lies four miles away, and a cart waits for them outside (they will have to push it by hand).
Inside, Cainboak is clutches his sides.
\Pgls{basilisk} trampled over him, breaking an arm, a leg, and most of his ribs.
He won't be able to say much, or do anything.

\segment{lonelyRoad}% AREA
{Unfriendly Faces}% NAME
{\Glspl{guard} ahead carry a dangerous prisoner}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  Yesterday, six \glspl{guard} attacked a bandit camp.
  Three survivors fled with their captured leader --- \pgls{witch} called Guilter.
\end{exampletext}

As the troupe trundle slowly onwards, another wagon joins them from another road.
The back has a man, shackled to the ground, his arms held painfully outstretched.
He stares at the \glspl{pc} with pain and malice.

The \glspl{pc} may wish to overtake, the wagon in front, but they cannot move fast without damagine Cainboak.
Or they may wish to hang back, but this will make them very late to get to town.
