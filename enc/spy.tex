{\Pgls{woetide} travels to confront Greetfall about his debt}% SUMMARY

\woetide

\Gls{woetide} travels with a crew of traders
%(selling ropes and \glspl{ration})
to settle a dispute between the \Gls{tender}~Greetfall and \gls{proctor}~Shrewlame.

\begin{speechtext}
  Greetfall thinks that if he's far from town, he's far from the law.
  He thinks he can lie about anything he wants, and now he's contesting borrowing 100~\glsentrylongpl{gp}.
\end{speechtext}

{\Gls{tender} Greetfall is missing, his faceless corpse is lodged down the chimney}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
\Gls{tender} Greetfall works as a fence, selling the bodies of \glspl{monster}, without paying the usual 50\% tax to the \gls{templeOfBeasts}.

{Above the stables.\par}
Stoopcraw and Gaulbloat are a pair of little shits, barely seventeen years old.
%They love archery, but hate all other work.
Yesterday they shot \pgls{woodspy}, then decided to drag the corpse at Greetfall's \gls{lonelyTavern}.

The young archers took it up the stairs, took their 8~\glspl{sp} payment, and started drinking.
However, the \gls{woodspy} was not dead, just
\ifcase\thetemperature%
  lethargic from the cold.
\else%
  stunned and playing dead.
\fi%
Once Stoopcraw and Gaulbloat ran downstairs to drink, the \gls{woodspy} latched onto Greetfall's head, and chewed through the front of his skull.

The floor is covered in blood.
Two candles still burn, but his corpse has gone.

Guests continue to arrive, but remain unserved.

  Above the stables, a locked room has two \gls{crawler} spinnerets and three \gls{woodspy} beaks encased in small barrels of alegar (worth around 10~\glspl{sp})
  The door's complex string-mechanism can be opened without a trace with an \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny} roll at \tn[9].
  Or someone can just cut the mechanism with a thin knife.

  A single piece of wood in the roof here slides to the side.
  This does nothing except allow another piece of wood to move to the side.
  The `puzzle' is easy, but rings a bell (unless one moves each piece of wood very slowly).
  After the bell-slat, a bag becomes visible, containing 2\arabic{r12}~\glspl{gp}.

  After Stoopcraw and Gaulbloat sold the \gls{woodspy} corpse to Greetfall, they helped him carry it up to the \gls{harvesting} room, then left to drink as Greetfall gathered his candles and knives.

Once the troupe arrive, they find an overworked \gls{server}, but no proprietor.
Everyone starts shouting at \gls{server}~Gobvore to get some some ale, but she can't keep up while working alone.
\Gls{tender}~Greetfall told her that he is not to be disturbed under any circumstances (he wanted solitude and secrecy while \gls{harvesting} the \gls{woodspy} corpse) so she will try to stop the \glspl{pc} from contacting him, and won't go up.

\subsubsection{Gobvore}
can lead the \glspl{pc} to their quarters (room~\ref{lt:guard} \vpageref{Dyson_Logos/lonely_tavern_2_a}, shown \vpageref{Dyson_Logos/lonely_tavern_1}), before she finds the soup is burning in the cauldron.
The patrons complain bitterly about the black lumps in the soup (point~\vref{lt:fire}).

\subsubsection{Gaulbloat}
tells everyone in the tavern how much he's drunk, but he keeps losing count half-way through the `story'.
He has no intention of giving the \gls{templeOfBeasts} their 50\% cut of the money from selling the \gls{woodspy} corpse.
If \pgls{pc} pushes the matter, he argues, tells them to `take it up with \Gls{tender} Greetfall', threatens to kill them, vomits on them, then falls over.

\subsubsection{Upstairs}
the parlour slowly fills with smoke, as Greetfall's corpse has blocked the chimney (point~\vref{lt:parlour}).
The \glspl{pc} may find the problem and pull him down, or if they enter room~\vref{lt:guestFire} and notice his feet sticking out of the fireplace.
Or they may notice nothing, since every room in the \gls{lonelyTavern} lies in shadow, and the little tallow candles people wander with give just enough light to see your own feet.

Noticing the charcoal marks around the parlour, or the feint blood-spatters leading into room~\vref{lt:guestFire}, should not be assumed.
The \gls{gm} must provide a clear image of the darkness, and the few things the \glspl{pc} \emph{can} see, and the players should ask for details.

If players want to abstract this with a roll, they can roll \roll{Intelligence}{Vigilance} to plan a proper search.
\Pgls{bandAct} requires splitting up.
At \tn[6] they find the pool of blood in room~\vref{lt:cutting}, at 10 they find the corpse in the chimney,
and at 12 they find the \gls{woodspy} in room~\vref{lt:woodspy}, inside a chest.

\paragraph{If Greetfall's corpse falls out,}
\Gls{woetide} accuses Shrewlame of murder, since Greetfall denied owing the money to the \gls{templeOfHate}.

Shrewlame says that Greetfall has killed someone, removed their face to confuse everyone, and run away into the forest.
He demands that the troupe go and search around the forest immediately.

Gobvore wants everyone to check on the horses but won't go outside after dark.

The \gls{woodspy} remains, resting quietly, until night, when everyone hides in their own rooms.

\paragraph{Don't lose pace}
by letting players theorize for an hour.
Make \glspl{npc} join their conversation with their own opinions.
If the players want privacy, the \glspl{pc} will have to go up to their room.

Soon after, the \glspl{npc} retire, then sleep.

{Creaking Stairs}% NAME
{The first is a human, the next \pgls{monster}}% SUMMARY

Once the tavern dies down, and everyone sleeps, \gls{woetide} goes down the creaking stairs to the latrines outside.
Anyone on \pgls{vigil} hears her footsteps.

\woodspy

Soon after, the \gls{woodspy} comes down, and climbs up the stairs then \emph{up} onto the roof (where Gaulbloat sang).
If nobody woke Gaulbloat, the \gls{woodspy} eats him, leaving a pool of blood, then enters the well (noted \vpageref{Dyson_Logos/lonely_tavern_0}).

\act{track the \gls{woodspy}}{Wits}{Survival}{10}
Meanwhile, the \gls{lonelyTavern} fills with accusations and theories.
Shrewlame tries to search for any valuables he can soon after, to ``take back what's owed him''.
\Gls{woetide} wants to get statements from everyone, and tells Shrewlame he can't take the money he's owed from a dead man.

\segment[\gls{night}]{lonelyTavern}% AREA
{The Sound of Horses}% NAME
{Shrewlame skulks atop the stables, searching for what's owed}% SUMMARY

\begin{boxtext}
  The horses in the stables shriek, and batter their hooves against the wood.
\end{boxtext}

If the \glspl{pc} enter the stables (\gls{area}~\vref{lt:stables}) they find nothing.
But if they listen closely, they hear something moving upstairs (\gls{area}~\vref{lt:stash}).

Shrewlame has decided to take the money owed to him, so he's examining everything he can.
He finds the secret stash of \glspl{ingredient}, but not the money.
If anyone else finds the money, he demands it.

\segment[\gls{morning}]{lonelyTavern}% AREA
{Well Again}% NAME
{After a little time healing, the \gls{woodspy} has returned}% SUMMARY

The \gls{woodspy} crawls a little up the well, grabs Gobvore, and retreats back down, leaving no clue except the fact that the bucket is missing.

Soon after, the \gls{lonelyTavern} gets a new \gls{tender}, who buys a lot of guard dogs, and the \gls{woodspy} eats all of them.
This cycle continues until someone finds and kills the \gls{woodspy}.
