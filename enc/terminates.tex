{\Pgls{notary} travels to confront \pgls{tender}}% SUMMARY

\Gls{woetide} travels with a crew of traders (selling ropes and \glspl{ration}) to settle a dispute between the \gls{tender}~Greetfall and \gls{proctor}~Shrewlame.

\begin{speechtext}
  Greetfall thinks that if he's far from town, he's far from the law.
  He thinks he can lie about anything he wants, and now he's contesting borrowing 100~\glsentrylongpl{gp}.
\end{speechtext}

{Guardian of Ale}% NAME
{The first little shit drinks alone on the roof}% SUMMARY

Stoopcraw and Gaulbloat are a pair of little shits, and barely seventeen years old.
They love archery, but hate all other work.
So when they shot \pgls{woodspy}, they sold it as the nearest \gls{lonelyTavern} for 12~\glspl{sp} and started drinking.

\begin{boxtext}
  A tuneless song assaults your ears, theorizing about how \glspl{woodspy} mate.
  Ahead, the singer stands on the third storey of \pgls{lonelyTavern}.
  As the rest of the building comes into view, it shows more wall, but not a single window.
  Even the side-building with double-doors --- presumably for horses --- shuts itself off from the intrusion of Sunlight.

Once inside, they find Gaulbloat, telling everyone in the tavern how much he's drunk, but he keeps losing count half-way through the `story'.

Gaulbloat has no intention of giving the \gls{templeOfBeasts} their 50\% cut of the money.
If \pgls{pc} pushes the matter, he argues, tells them to take the matter up with \gls{tender} Greetfall, threatens to kill them, vomits on them, then falls over.

The tavern patrons complain about how long \gls{tender} Greetfall has been upstairs.
Nobody can get a drink, so \gls{server} Gobvore --- a young waitress with eyes as vacant as a pigeon --- attempts to take the initiative and take payments from everyone while refilling from the pantry (room \vref{lt:pantry}).

\begin{speechtext}
  \Gls{tender} Greetfall?
  He went upstairs, \gls{harvesting} the \gls{woodspy} I suppose.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} hunt upstairs}
they won't find Gaulbloat easily, because the \gls{woodspy} he bought was not dead, merely wounded.
It held his throat until he died, and ate his face.

Searching every room reveals the pool of blood in room \vref{lt:cutting}.
The \gls{woodspy} remains hidden in room \vref{lt:woodspy}, inside an empty chest of old linens.
Searching the place requires a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll at \tn[12] as \pgls{bandAct}.
A tie indicates \pgls{pc} find the \gls{woodspy} while the others are spread apart, $1D6 \times 10$~\glspl{step} away each.

Shrewlame storms out of his room, with a scowl which somehow penetrates the beard.
The patrons panic.

\Gls{woetide} accuses Shrewlame of murder, because she heard someone coming downstairs while she was in her room.
Shrewlame says that Greetfall has killed someone, removed their face, and run away into the forest.
Gobvore wants everyone to check on the horses but won't go outside after dark.

Shrewlame also heard someone coming down the stairs, but made nothing of it.

{Creaking Stairs}% NAME
{The first is a human, the next \pgls{monster}}% SUMMARY

Once the tavern dies down, and everyone sleeps, \gls{woetide} goes down the creaking stairs (room \ref{lt:stairs}) to the latrines, outside (area \ref{lt:latrines}).
Any \gls{pc} on \pgls{vigil} will hear her, otherwise they can roll \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} at \tn[12].

Soon after, the \gls{woodspy} comes down, and climbs out the stairs (room \ref{lt:runway}) then \emph{up} onto the roof.
From this vantage point, it can rest, and nothing can see it, except for Gaulbloat (who fell asleep after singing on the roof).
It kills Gaulbloat, then slowly feeds on him.
But this time, the blood drips down --- \textit{tap, tap, tap} --- onto the stairs.
The moment the \gls{woodspy} notices this, it leaves, and enters the well (noted \vpageref{Dyson_Logos/lonely_tavern_0}).

Tracking the \gls{woodspy} requires a \roll{Wits}{Survival} roll at \tn[10].
Meanwhile, the \gls{lonelyTavern} fills with accusations and theories.
Shrewlame demands that the troupe go into the forest with \pgls{torch} to search for Greetfall.
\Gls{woetide} wants to get statements from everyone, and tells Shrewlame he can't take the money he's owed from a dead man.

{Well Again}% NAME
{After a little time healing, the \gls{woodspy} has returned}% SUMMARY

The \gls{woodspy} crawls a little up the well, grabs Gobvore, and retreats back down, leaving no clue except the fact that the bucket is missing.

Soon after, the \gls{lonelyTavern} gets a new \gls{tender}, who buys a lot of guard dogs.
The \gls{woodspy} eats all of them.
This cycle continues until someone finds and kills the \gls{woodspy}.

\segment[\gls{night}]{broch}% AREA
{The Voiceless Roc}% NAME
{The \glsfmttext{jotter} needs someone to kill a local \glsfmttext{griffin}}% SUMMARY

Thunder threatens, as \glspl{guard} talk business in Rankvore \gls{broch}.
``\textit{The farmers say the \gls{griffin}'s as big as a house.
They say it picked up a sheep and just flew away.''}

After the pipes at dusk, \gls{jotter} \composeHumanName\ gives the \glspl{pc} the privilege of going to Tallbow \gls{village} to kill that \gls{griffin}, and bring it back, for a 50\% cut of the value of the corpse.

\segment{lonelyRoad}% AREA
{What Lies in the Forest}% NAME
{\Pgls{griffin} mimics a dog's bark from the forest}% SUMMARY

Passing the forest, the troupe hear endless barking noises, each one a perfect repetition of the last.
The noise comes from \pgls{griffin}, imitating the sound that it associates with sheep.

The \gls{griffin} soon goes silent, but the troupe can find the tree it stands on with a \roll{Intelligence}{Survival} roll at \tn[8].
If they talk or make noises as they approach, it imitates them perfectly, then jumps from the treetop and flies somewhere nearby, and repeats.

\segment[\gls{vlg}]{village}% AREA
{Competition}% NAME
{Other \glsfmtplural{guard} hack at the bushes, but wish they could kill the \gls{griffin}}% SUMMARY

As the skies clear, \glspl{pc} arrive in Tallbow \gls{village}, which has two giant \glspl{crossbow} along its massive wooden wall.
The giant \glspl{crossbow} have a -2~Penalty to aim, but inflict \dmg{4}~Damage.

Three \glspl{guard} \glspl{gDigger} --- \composeHumanName, \composeHumanName, and \composeHumanName\ --- have the unhappy duty of cutting down the bushes and trees around the farmland outside the walls, this gives the local archers more space to see danger coming towards people in the fields.
They hate the menial chore, and accuse the \glspl{pc} of nepotism.

\begin{itemize}\it
  \item
  Hey \gls{jotter}'s pet!
  How much you giving him to get the profitable missions?
  \item
  What's your rank?
  I'm \pgls{gDigger}, why can't I get this job?
\end{itemize}

If the \glspl{pc} agree to split the profits from the \gls{griffin}'s corpse, the \glspl{gDigger} help happily.
The farmers have sided with the \glspl{gDigger}, and ask the \glspl{pc} to sleep outside the walls.
However, they will help \gls{harvesting} the \gls{griffin}'s corpse once it's dead.

\segment[\gls{evening}]{village}% AREA
{Echoes}% NAME
{The \glsfmttext{griffin} mimics \pgls{pc}}% SUMMARY
The \gls{griffin} mimics \pgls{pc}, but won't attack until someone stands away from the rest (and outside the \gls{village}).
One they leave, the \gls{griffin} swoop-attacks, attempting to grab any character with \pgls{weight} under 6.
If it receives Damage, it's forced to land; once down it cannot fly without climbing a tree.

After one swoop the \gls{griffin} leaves for $1D6$ days.
The farmers of Tallbow suggest the \glspl{pc} go into the forest and hunt for it immediately.

The \glspl{gDigger} finish their work after three days and leave.
