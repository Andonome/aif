\thread{\marketFence's Proposal}

\begin{speechtext}
  I have books on \emph{history}, \emph{preservation}, and \emph{secretive cures} for breathrot and meat grippes.
  I have \glspl{boon} made from sentient mushrooms in the \gls{deep}, and signet rings forged by dwarves who haven't taken a holiday in twenty years.
  I know buyers in \gls{ftown} who would sell their own children's teeth for a \underline{chance} to see my wares.
  I have paid five \glsentrylongpl{gp} \underline{up-front} to \pgls{jotter} at the \gls{templeOfBeasts} for guardianship to the mountain-pass, and down the open plains which lead to \gls{ftown}, to sell my goods.

  Day one: the \glspl{ranger} I paid up-front disappear on an `urgent mission'.
  Am I not `urgent'?
  Do I not seem `\underline{urgent}' to you?

  Join me from here untill the first \gls{village}.
  If my cargo and donkeys arrive safely, I will pay three \glsentrylongpl{gp},%
  \footnote{She negotiates up to 8~\glspl{gp}.}
  and will sell any \gls{monster}-corpse after \gls{harvesting}, completely \underline{tax-free} (and the \gls{templeOfBeasts} can eat \gls{sylf}-shit).
  So your journey will be \emph{easy}, or \emph{profitable}.

{A Friendly Face}% NAME
{\Pgls{guard} joins, determined to do everything by the book}% SUMMARY

\Gls{soldier} Perspic does things by the book.
He pays the full 50\% tax to the \gls{templeOfBeasts} every time he kills \pgls{monster}, and believes everyone else should do the same, or he will report them to the nearest \gls{jotter}.

\begin{boxtext}
  Ahead, four people in black leather armour sit around a stinking mass of tentacles.
  One stands, waving enthusiastically, then rushes over to introduce himself as `\Gls{soldier} Perspic'.
  He explains that he and the three \glspl{gDigger} with him have killed \pgls{woodspy}, and they've almost finished \gls{harvesting} the corpse.
  He asks you to help him carry it to \brochOne, just a mile out of your way.

\paragraph{Once Perspic delivers the \gls{woodspy},}
the \gls{broch}'s \gls{jotter} tells him to join the \glspl{pc}, as they `might need help'.
He salutes with an extra hand-twirl, and chases after the cart.

Whether or not the \glspl{pc} invite or help Perspic, he will join them.
And he will make sure that nothing dubious or `un-guildly' happens.
And every night he shares his biscuits and tells stories, like the time he killed \pgls{crawler}, or the time he killed two of the `gong bandits' by \gls{ftown},%
\footnote{If anyone asks why they're called `the gong bandits', he says `I don't remember, it doesn't matter'.}
or the time he helped \Gls{warden}~Fell host a socially tenuous dinner-party with \pgls{chef} and \pgls{seneschal}.

The troupe will arrive at \bothyOne\ before Sundown.

{Uncivilized Smoke}% NAME
{Someone left their possessions unguarded in the forest}% SUMMARY
\label{rangerCamp}

\begin{exampletext}
  The \glspl{ranger} who once helped \marketFence\ went to raid a bandit camp.
  They stopped in the forest last night, cooked over a fire-pit, and left some items to avoid being weighed down during the fight.
  They also left the fire smouldering, just enough to give off smoke until a few minutes after Sunrise.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}
  Out the \gls{bothy} door, by the dawn's red light, you see a single plume of smoke rising from the forest, half a mile away.
  By the time \marketFence\ wakes up and prepares, the smoke has gone.

  ``\textit{Let's get moving}'', she says.
\end{boxtext}

The \glspl{ranger} left a bag with \lootBig, two sleeping bags, three \glspl{torch}, rope (15~\glspl{step} long), \rations, \rations, and \rations.

\vspace{-1\baselineskip}

\segment[\gls{afternoon}]{bothy}% AREA
{Surprise Guest}% NAME
{\Pgls{woodspy} waits in the \gls{bothy}}% SUMMARY

Unlike most \glspl{bothy}, \bothyTwo\ has a separate room with a chamberpot
(an `in-door out-house').
And unlike most out-houses, this one has \pgls{woodspy} on the ceiling.

\begin{boxtext}[How does everyone rest?]
  Slidy-tracks lead up to \bothyTwo\ --- one of the largest in the land.
  The donkeys stop automatically, knowing they will rest soon.
\end{boxtext}

If the troupe don't notice the `slidy' (\gls{woodspy}) tracks, the \gls{woodspy} ambushes the first to use the indoor-outhouse (pick the \glspl{pc} with the highest Speed \gls{attribute}).
Once the door shuts, the \gls{woodspy} descends from above;
tentacles wrap around their throat, trying to silence them.%
\footnote{At this point, ask the other players, `if someone doesn't come out of the toilet for a long time, what would you do?'.
Remember their answer, then resolve the attack.}
Once the \gls{woodspy} kills, it holds the door shut and begins to feed.

\woodspy

If the troupe kill the \gls{woodspy}, the body has \pgls{weight} of \arabic{hp} after \gls{harvesting}, and a well-preserved beak has \pgls{weight} of 1.%
\ifcase\thetemperature\relax\or
  The parts rot after \arabic{r2t4}~days.

  The remains rot after \arabic{r2t3}~days.

\segment[\gls{afternoon}]{Mountain}% AREA
{Unfriendly Faces}% NAME
{\Glspl{guard} ahead carry a dangerous prisoner}% SUMMARY

\begin{exampletext}
  The \glspl{ranger} rased the bandit camp as the bandits fled.
  Half the \glspl{ranger} lay dead.
  But they managed to capture the bandit's leader --- \pgls{witch} known as `Guilter'.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}[]
  As the forest thins, mountains rise ahead.
  A small wagon
  \ifnum\thetemperature=0%
    crunches through the mountain's snow-cloak,
  \else%
    trundles along the little path that winds up the mountain,
  \fi%
  pulled by two men and a horse.
\end{boxtext}

High up the infertile mountains, you can skip all normal encounters.
The \glspl{ranger} travel slowly, and the troop will catch up to them soon.

  \npcQuote{hey relax, guys!}%
  \label{vicRangers}]

\begin{boxtext}[]
  Approaching the cart, you see it holds a man with a long beard and bald head, tied with his arms pulled outwards.
  Behind him, a pile of sacks.

  The path has barely enough room for one wagon, and you clearly cannot pass with the donkey troika.
\end{boxtext}

\Gls{ranger} Rotbulge doesn't want the \glspl{pc} investigating his sacks.
They contain fourteen longswords, taken from the bandits, and he has no intention of paying tax on any of them.

\begin{speechtext}
  Look, I'm sorry about slowing you down, but it's great having yous back there.
  We know old Guilter's going nowhere with you watching him.
  If you want to help, you can push from behind, and give Wiltcull and the horse a breather.
\end{speechtext}

\paragraph{If the troupe find out about the swords,}
the \glspl{ranger} become defensive.

\begin{speechtext}
  When it comes to selling longswords, bandits fall under the purview of the \gls{templeOfJustice}.
  When it comes to killing bandits, they fall under the \gls{templeOfBeasts}.
  How the fuck is that fair?
\end{speechtext}

\paragraph{Perspic demands to do everything by the book,}
and if the \glspl{pc} stop him demanding and threatening to report the \glspl{ranger}, then the \glspl{ranger} will not be inclined to help them, or let them pass.

If the \glspl{pc} do nothing about the \gls{witch} staring at them, Guilter looks for the worst possible moments to cast spells on them.
If he escapes, he grabs his backpack (sitting next to him on the cart) and 

\segment{Mountain}% AREA
{Passing Places}% NAME
{The troupe decide whether or not to overtake}% SUMMARY

Soon the \glspl{ranger}'s wagon reaches a wider spot on the road, where two wagons can pass each other.
They don't want the troupe to overtake them, so they speed up suddenly.
The troupe can out-pace them
\ifnum\thetemperature=0
  with a \roll{Strength}{Empathy} (\tn[8]) roll to push the cart with the donkies.
  Failure means the cart slips on the ice, and plummets, and smashes into $1D6$ pieces.
\else%
  if they try.
\fi

If the troupe overtake, they can reach the mountain pass after \pgls{interval}.
If not, they need two.

\segment{Mountain}% AREA
{Eirie}% NAME
{Any noise summons \glspl{griffin}}% SUMMARY

\griffin[\npc{\T[2]\A}{\Glsfmtplural{griffin}}]

Any loud noises or lights in the dark attracts two \glspl{griffin}.
They find a distant, craggy perch and wait for someone to pass by a precarious spot.
Then they swoop-and-grab, and try to pull their prey off the cliff-side.

\segment{Valley}% AREA
{The Gong Bandits}% NAME
{A wooden \gls{crawler} has a gong hidden inside}% SUMMARY

\humanarcher[%
  \npc{\ifnum\thepage>12\T[8]\else\T[10]\fi\Hu}%
  {\arabic{noAppearing}~Gong Bandits}%
]

The troupe spot \pgls{crawler}, hanging in the forest.
A \roll{Wits}{Survival} roll at \tn[12] will tell them that someone made this `\gls{crawler}' out of wood.
And if anyone says that it's made out of wood to the \glspl{ranger}, then the \glspl{ranger} can tell the \glspl{pc} that the facsimile has a gong hidden inside it, because that is how the gong bandits --- who live on this side of the mountain --- find out that \glspl{guard} have arrived.

\paragraph{If an arrow hits,}
the gong sounds, and the bandits prepare \pgls{ambush}.
Two miles down the road, the bandits wait silently with their \glspl{bow} strung, 20~\glspl{step} into the forest's shadows.

\ifnum\thepage<14
  \paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} left the \glspl{ranger} camp untouched}
  (\gls{segment}~\vref{rangerCamp})
  then two \glspl{ranger} have made it across the mountains, via the secret bandit-path.
  They hear the gong, and stalk through the forest to investigate.
  They join the fight after \pgls{round}, behind the gong bandits.
  Use the same \gls{statblock} as the others, \vpageref{vicRangers}.
\fi

\bigLine

\begin{boxtext}[]
  Over a hill, you see a vast, 
  \ifcase\thetemperature%
    snowy-white plain.
  \or%
    squelching-wet plain.
  \or%
    verdant, plain.
  \else%
    dry plain, ripe for \pgls{burn}.
  \fi%
  At the far edge, dozens of aurochs graze.
  Closer, \pgls{village} waits for you at the end of the \gls{lonelyRoad}.
  And half a mile below, the trees begin to thin, as the forest melts into the open land.
\end{boxtext}

After five more miles, the troupe arrive at that first \gls{village}, where \marketFence\ leaves them to sell her wares in \gls{ftown}.
Although if they \emph{need} to go to town, she can organize for a `\gls{fodder}-pass' for only 2~\glspl{sp} each.
